<h2>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>


<p>The extent to which railways are being used in the
present War of the Nations has taken quite by surprise a
world whose military historians, in their accounts of what
armies have done or have failed to do on the battle-field in
the past, have too often disregarded such matters of detail
as to how the armies got there and the possible effect of good
or defective transport conditions, including the maintenance
of supplies and communications, on the whole course
of a campaign.</p>

<p>In the gigantic struggle now proceeding, these matters
of detail are found to be of transcendant importance. The
part which railways are playing in the struggle has, indeed&mdash;in
keeping with the magnitude of the struggle itself&mdash;assumed
proportions unexampled in history. Whilst this is so it is,
nevertheless, a remarkable fact that although much has
been said as to the conditions of military unpreparedness
in which the outbreak of hostilities in August, 1914, found
the Allies, there has, so far as I am aware, been no suggestion
of any inability on the part of the railways to meet, at
once, from the very moment war was declared, all the
requirements of military transport. In this respect, indeed,
the organisation, the preparedness, and the efficiency
throughout alike of the British and of the French railways
have been fully equal to those of the German railways
themselves.</p>

<p>As regards British conditions, especially, much interest
attaches to some remarks made by Sir Charles Owens, formerly
General Manager of the London and South Western
Railway Company, in the course of an address delivered by
him to students of the London School of Economics on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
October 12, 1914. He told how, some five or six years
ago, he had met at a social function the Secretary of State
for War, who, after dinner, took him aside and asked,
"Do you think in any emergency which might arise in
this country the railways would be able to cope with it
adequately?" To this question Sir Charles replied, "I
will stake my reputation as a railway man that the country
could not concentrate men and materials half so fast as
the railways could deal with them; but the management
of the railways must be left in the hands of railway men."
We have here an affirmation and a proviso. That the
affirmation was warranted has been abundantly proved by
what the British railways have accomplished in the emergency
that has arisen. The special significance of the
proviso will be understood in the light of what I record in
the present work concerning the control of railways in war.</p>

<p>Taking the railways of all the countries, whether friends
or foes, concerned in the present World-War, and assuming,
for the sake of argument, that all, without exception, have
accomplished marvels in the way of military transport,
one must, nevertheless, bear in mind two important considerations:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) That, apart from the huge proportions of the scale
upon which, in the aggregate, the railways are being required
to serve military purposes, the present conflict, in spite of
its magnitude, has thus far produced no absolutely new
factor in the employment of railways for war except as
regards the use of air-craft for their destruction.</p>

<p>(2) That when hostilities were declared in August, 1914,
the subject of the employment of railways for the purposes
of war had already been under the consideration of railway
and military experts in different countries for no fewer than
eighty years, during which period, and as the result of
vast study, much experience, and many blunders in or
between wars in various parts of the world, there had been
slowly evolved certain fixed principles and, also, subject
to constant amendments, a recognised and comprehensive
organisation which, accepted more or less completely by
the leading nations, with modifications to suit their national<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
circumstances and conditions, was designed to meet all
contingencies, to provide, as far as human foresight could
suggest, for all possible difficulties, and be capable of application
instantly the need for it might arise.</p>

<p>The time has not yet come for telling all that the railways
have thus far done during the war which has still to be
fought out. That story, in the words of a railway man
concerned therein, is at present "a sealed book." Meanwhile,
however, it is desirable that the position as defined in
the second of the two considerations given above should be
fully realised, in order that what the railways and, so far as
they have been aided by them, the combatants, have accomplished
or are likely to accomplish may be better understood
when the sealed book becomes an open one.</p>

<p>If, as suggested at the outset, the world has already been
taken by surprise even by what the railways are known to
have done, it may be still more surprised to learn (as the
present work will show) that the construction of railways
for strategical purposes was advocated in Germany as early
as 1833; that in 1842 a scheme was elaborated for covering
Germany with a network of strategical railways which,
while serving the entire country, would more especially
allow of war being conducted on two fronts&mdash;France and
Russia&mdash;at the same time; and that in the same year (1842)
attention was already being called in the French Chamber
to the "aggressive lines" which Germany was building in
the direction of France, while predictions were also being
made that any new invasion of France by Germany would
be between Metz and Strasburg.</p>

<p>If, again, it is found that a good deal of space is devoted
in the present work to the War of Secession, criticism may,
perhaps, be disarmed by the explanation that the American
Civil War was practically the beginning of things as regards
the scientific use of railways for war, and that many of the
problems connected therewith were either started in the
United States or were actually worked out there, precedents
being established and examples being set which the rest
of the world had simply to follow, adapt or perfect. The
possibility of carrying on warfare at a great distance from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the base of supplies by means of even a single line of single-track
railway; the creation of an organised corps for the
restoration, operation or destruction of railways; the
control of railways in war by the railway or the military
interests independently or jointly; the question as to
when the railway could be used to advantage and when it
would be better for the troops to march; the use of armoured
trains; the evolution of the ambulance or the hospital
train&mdash;all these, and many other matters besides, are to be
traced back to the American Civil War of 1861-65, and are
dealt with herein at what, it is hoped, will be found not
undue length.</p>

<p>As for the building up of the subsequent organisation in
Europe&mdash;Germany, France and England being the countries
selected for special treatment in relation thereto&mdash;this,
also, has had to be described with some regard for
detail; and, incidentally, it is shown (1) that the alleged
perfection of Germany's arrangements when she went to
war with France in 1870-71 is merely one of the fictions of
history, so far as her military rail-transport was concerned;
(2) that France learned the bitter lesson taught her by the
deplorable and undeniable imperfections of her own transport
system&mdash;or no-system&mdash;on that occasion, and at once
set about the creation of what was to become an organisation
of the most complete and comprehensive character;
and (3) that the "beginning of things" in England, in the
way of employing railways for the purposes of war, was the
direct outcome of the conditions of semi-panic created
here in 1859 by what was regarded as the prospect of an
early invasion of this country by France, coupled with the
then recognised deficiencies of our means of national defence.</p>

<p>Military railways, as employed in the Crimean War, the
Abyssinian Campaign, the Franco-German War, the Russo-Turkish
War and the Sudan are described; a detailed
account is given of the use of railways in the Boer War and
the Russo-Japanese War; and this is followed by a description
of the strategical railways constructed in Germany
for the purpose of facilitating war on the possessions of
her neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>Chapters XIX and XX deal with the building of railways
which, whether avowedly strategical or what I have described
as "economic-political-strategical," are intended to
effect the purposes of conquest, with or without the accompaniment
of war. The former of these two chapters, which
shows how, with the help of railways, Germany proposed
to transform the African continent into an African Empire
of her own, should be found deserving of notice, and especially
so in view of the statements quoted (p. <a href="#Page_311">311</a>) as having been
made by German officers in what was then German
South-West Africa, to the effect that the main objective of
Germany in going to war would be the conquest of Africa,
"the smashing up of France and Great Britain" being
regarded only as "incidents" which, followed by seizure
of the possessions of the smaller Powers, would make
Germany the supreme Power in Africa, and lead to the
whole African continent becoming a German possession.</p>

<p>From Chapter XX the reader will learn how Germany
proposed to employ railways for the furthering of her aims
against, not only Asiatic Turkey, but Egypt and India, as
well.</p>

<p>The subsidiary articles on "Indian Frontier Railways"
and "The Defence of Australia" have no direct bearing
on that <i>evolution</i> of rail-power in warfare with which it is
the special purpose of the present volume to deal; but in
the belief that they are of interest and importance in
themselves, from the point of view of the general question,
they have been given in an Appendix. The difficulties and
other conditions under which the Sind-Pishin State Railway,
designed to serve strategical purposes, was built to the frontiers
of Afghanistan are unexampled in the history either of
railways or of war. As regards Australia, the gravity of the
position there was well indicated by Lord Kitchener when
he wrote of the lines running inland that they were "of
little use for defence, although possibly of considerable
value to an enemy who would have temporary command
of the sea."</p>

<p>At the end of the volume there is a Bibliography of
books, pamphlets and review or other articles relating to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
the use of railways for the purposes of war. In the first
instance this compilation was based on a "List of References"
prepared by the American Bureau of Railway
Economics; but, while many items on that list have here
been omitted, a considerable number of others have been
inserted from other sources. The Bibliography is not offered
as being in any way complete, but it may, nevertheless,
be of advantage to students desirous of making further
researches into the matters of history here specially
treated.</p>

<p>The assistance rendered in other ways by the American
Bureau of Railway Economics in the preparation of the
present work has been most helpful. In the writing of the
chapters concerning German designs on Africa, Asia Minor,
etc., the resources of the well-arranged and admirably-indexed
library of the Royal Colonial Institute have been of
great service. I have, also, to express cordial acknowledgments
to the General Managers and other officers of various
leading railway companies for information given respecting
the organisation of railways in this country for military
purposes.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Rail-Power in<br />
War and Conquest</h2>


<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="smcap">A New Factor</span></h2>


<p>While the original purpose of railways was to promote
the arts of peace, the wide scope of their possibilities in the
direction, also, of furthering the arts of war began to be
realised at a very early date after their success in the former
capacity had been assured in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Already the canal system had introduced an innovation
which greatly impressed the British public. In December,
1806, a considerable body of troops went by barge on the
Paddington Canal from London to Liverpool, <i>en route</i> for
Dublin, relays of fresh horses for the canal boats being
provided at all the stages in order to facilitate the transport;
and in referring to this event <i>The Times</i> of December 19,
1806, remarked:&mdash;"By this mode of conveyance the men
will be only seven days in reaching Liverpool, and with
comparatively little fatigue, as it would take them above
fourteen days to march that distance."</p>

<p>But when, on the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, in 1830, a British regiment was conveyed
thereon, in two hours, a journey of thirty-four miles, which
they would have required two days to accomplish on foot,
far-seeing men became still more impressed, and began to
realise that there had, indeed, been introduced a new
factor destined to exercise a powerful influence on the
future conduct of war.</p>

<p>The geographical position of the United Kingdom led,
in those early days, to greater importance being attached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to the conveniences of railways as a means of transport
than to their actual strategical and tactical advantages;
and the issue by the War Office, in 1846, of a "Regulation
Relative to the Conveyance of Her Majesty's Forces, their
Baggage and Stores, by Rail," may have appeared to meet
the requirements of the immediate situation, so far as this
country was concerned.</p>

<p>On the Continent of Europe, however, the rivalry of
nations divided from one another only by a more or less
uncertain or varying frontier, and still powerfully influenced
by the recollection of recent conflicts, resulted in much
greater attention being paid to the possibilities of the new
development.</p>

<p>The first definite proposals for the use of railways for
strategical purposes were advanced, as early as 1833, by
Friedrich Wilhelm Harkort, a Westphalian worthy who
came to be better known in his native land as "<span xml:lang="de">Der alte
Harkort</span>." A participant in the Napoleonic wars, he had
subsequently shown great energy and enterprise in the
development of steam engines, hydraulic presses, iron-making,
and other important industries in Germany; he had
been the first writer in that country to give an account&mdash;as
he did in 1825&mdash;of the progress England was making
in respect to railways and steamships; and he had, in 1826,
placed a working model of a railway in the garden of the
Elberfeld Museum. These various efforts he followed up,
in 1833, by bringing forward in the Westphalian Landtag
a scheme for the building of a railway to connect the Weser
and the Lippe. Later in the same year he published "<span xml:lang="de">Die
Eisenbahn von Minden nach Köln</span>," in which he laid special
stress on the value to Germany of the proposed line from a
military point of view. With the help of such a railway,
he argued, it would be possible to concentrate large bodies
of troops at a given point much more speedily than if they
marched by road; he made calculations as to what the
actual saving in time, as well as in physical strain, would
be in transporting Prussian troops from various specified
centres to others; and he proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Let us suppose that we had a railway and a telegraph line
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>on the right bank of the Rhine, from Mainz to Wesel. Any
crossing of the Rhine by the French would then scarcely be
possible, since we should be able to bring a strong defensive
force on the spot before the attempt could be developed.</p>

<p>These things may appear very strange to-day; yet in the
womb of the future there slumbers the seed of great developments
in railways, the results of which it is, as yet, quite beyond
our powers to foresee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harkort's proposals gave rise to much vigorous controversy
in Germany. The official classes condemned as
"nonsensical fancies" his ideas, not only as to the usefulness
of railways for the conveyance of troops, but, also,
as to the utility of railways for any practical purposes
whatever; and contemporary newspapers and periodicals,
in turn, made him the butt of their ridicule.</p>

<p>The pros and cons of the use of railways for military
purposes were, none the less, actively discussed in numerous
pamphlets and treatises. Just as, in France, General
Rumigny, adjutant to Louis-Philippe, had already foreshadowed
the possibility of a sudden invasion by a German
army reaching the frontier by rail, so, also, in Germany,
in the words of one writer at this period, "anxious spirits
shudder at the thought that, some fine spring morning,
a hundred thousand Frenchmen, thirsting for war, will
suddenly invade our peaceful valleys at bird-like speed,
thanks to the new means of locomotion, and begin their
old game (<i xml:lang="de">das alte Spiel</i>) over again." On the other hand
there were military sceptics&mdash;such as the author of a pamphlet
"<span xml:lang="de">Uber die Militärische Benutzung der Eisenbahnen</span>"
(Berlin, 1836)&mdash;who, basing their calculations on locomotive
performances up to that date, asserted that, although the
railway might be of service in the conveyance of supplies,
guns and ammunition, it would be of no advantage in the
transport of troops. These, they declared, would get to
their destination sooner if they marched.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>The most noticeable of the various publications issued in
Germany at this period was a book by Carl Eduard Pönitz
("Pz."), which appeared at Adorf, Saxony, in 1842, under
the title of "<span xml:lang="de">Die Eisenbahnen als militärische Operationslinien
betrachtet, und durch Beispiele erlaütert</span>." The
writer of this remarkable book (of which a second edition
was issued in 1853) gave a comprehensive survey of the
whole situation in regard to railways and war, so far as the
subject could be dealt with in the light of railway developments
and of actual experiences of troop movements by
rail down to that time; and he argued strongly in favour
of the advantages to be derived from the employment of
railways for military purposes. He even suggested that,
in the event of an inadequate supply of locomotives, or of
operations having to be conducted in a mountainous country
where locomotives could not be used for heavy traffic, the
troops might still use their own horses to draw the coaches
and wagons along the railway lines, so that the men would
arrive fresh and fit for immediate fighting at the end of
their journey.</p>

<p>Describing railways as the most powerful vehicle for the
advancement of "Kultur" since the invention of printing,
Pönitz showed how Belgium and Saxony were the two
countries which had taken the initiative in railway construction
on the Continent of Europe; and his references to the
former country are especially deserving of being recalled,
in view of recent events. He pointed to the good example
which had been set by the "far-sighted and energetic"
King of the Belgians, and continued:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Although, in a land torn asunder by revolutionary factions,
many wounds were still bleeding; and although the newly-created
kingdom was threatened by foes within and without
and could organise means of resistance only with great difficulty,
there was, nevertheless, taken in hand a scheme for the
construction of a network of railways designed to extend over
the entire country, while at the present moment the greater
part of that scheme has, in fact, been carried out. In this way
King Leopold has raised up for himself a memorial the full
value and significance of which may, perhaps, be appreciated
only by generations yet to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>While Belgium was thus shown to have been setting a
good example, the only railways which Prussia then had
in actual operation (apart from the Berlin-Stettin and the
Berlin-Breslau lines, which had been begun, and others
which had been projected) were the Berlin-Potsdam and
the Berlin-Magdeburg-Leipzig lines; though Saxony had
the Leipzig-Dresden line, and Bavaria the Nüremberg-Fürth
and the Munich-Augsburg lines. Pönitz, however,
excused the backwardness of Prussia on the ground that
if her Government had refused, for a long time, to sanction
various projected railways, or had imposed heavy obligations
in regard to them, such action was due, not to prejudice,
but to "a wise foresight"&mdash;meaning, presumably,
that Prussia was waiting to profit by the experience that
other countries were gaining at their own cost.</p>

<p>Having dealt with all the arguments he could advance in
favour of the general principle of employing railways for
military purposes, Pönitz proceeded to elaborate a scheme
for the construction of a network of strategical lines serving
the whole of Germany, though intended, more especially,
to protect her frontiers against attack by either France or
Russia. Without, he said, being in the secrets of international
politics, he thought he might safely presume that
Germany's only fear of attack was from one of these two
directions; and, although the relations of the Great Powers
of Europe were then peaceful, a continuance of those
conditions could not, of course, be guaranteed. So, he
proceeded&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We have to look to these two fronts; and, if we want to
avoid the risk of heavy losses at the outset, we needs must&mdash;also
at the outset&mdash;be prepared to meet the enemy there
with an overwhelming force. Every one knows that the strength
of an army is multiplied by movements which are rapid in
themselves and allow of the troops arriving at the end of their
journey without fatigue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a powerful appeal&mdash;based on motives alike of
patriotism, of national defence and of economic advantage&mdash;that
his fellow-countrymen should support the scheme
he thus put forward, Pönitz once more pointed to
Belgium, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The youngest of all the European States has given us an
example of what can be done by intelligence and good will.
The network of Belgian railways will be of as much advantage
in advancing the industries of that country as it will be in facilitating
the defence of the land against attack by France. It
will increase alike Belgium's prosperity and Belgium's security.
And we Germans, who place so high a value on our intelligence,
and are scarcely yet inclined to recognise the political independence
of the Belgian people, shall we remain so blind as
not to see what is needed for our own safety?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pönitz could not, of course, anticipate in 1842 that the
time would come when his country, acting to the full on
the advice he was then giving, would have her strategic
railways, not only to the French and the Russian, but, also,
to the Belgian frontier, and would use those in the last-mentioned
direction to crush remorselessly the little nation
concerning which he himself was using words of such generous
sympathy and approbation.</p>

<p>The ideas and proposals put forward by Pönitz (of whose
work a French translation, under the title of "<span xml:lang="fr">Essai sur
les Chemins de Fer, considérés commes lignes d'opérations
militaires</span>," was published by L. A. Unger in Paris, in 1844)
did much to stimulate the discussion of the general question,
while the military authorities of Germany were moved to
make investigations into it on their own account, there
being issued in Berlin, about 1848 or 1850, a "Survey of the
Traffic and Equipment of German and of neighbouring
foreign Railways for military purposes, based on information
collected by the Great General Staff."<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In France, also, there were those who, quite early in the
days of the new means of transport, predicted the important
service it was likely to render for the purposes of war
no less than for those of peace.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>General Lamarque declared in the French Chamber of
Deputies in 1832, or 1833, that the strategical use of railways
would lead to "a revolution in military science as
great as that which had been brought about by the use of
gunpowder."</p>

<p>At the sitting of the Chamber on May 25, 1833, M. de
Bérigny, in urging the "incontestable" importance of
railways, said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From the point of view of national defence, what advantages
do they not present! An army, with all its material,
could, in a few days, be transported from the north to the south,
from the east to the west, of France. If a country could thus
speedily carry considerable masses of troops to any given point
on its frontiers, would it not become invincible, and would it
not, also, be in a position to effect great economies in its military
expenditure?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a further debate on June 8, 1837, M. Dufaure declared
that railways had a greater mission to fulfil than that of
offering facilities to industry or than that of conferring
benefits on private interests. Was it a matter of no account,
he asked, that they should be able in one night to send
troops to all the frontiers of France, from Paris to the
banks of the Rhine, from Lyons to the foot of the Alps,
with an assurance of their arriving fresh and ready for
combat?</p>

<p>Then, in 1842, M. Marschall, advocating the construction
of a line from Paris to Strasburg, predicted that any new
invasion of France by Germany would most probably be
attempted between Metz and Strasburg. He further said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is there that the German Confederation is converging a
formidable system of railways from Cologne, Mayence and
Mannheim.... Twenty-four hours will suffice for our neighbours
to concentrate on the Rhine the forces of Prussia, Austria
and the Confederation, and on the morrow an army of 400,000
men could invade our territory by that breach of forty leagues
between Thionville and Lauterburg, which are the outposts of
Strasburg and Metz. Three months later, the reserve system
organised in Prussia and in some of the other German States
would allow of a second Army being sent of equal force to the
other. The title of "aggressive lines" given by our neighbours
to these railways leave us with no room for doubt as to
their intentions. Studies for an expedition against Paris by
way of Lorraine and Champagne can hardly be regarded as
indicative of a sentiment of fraternity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>France, however, had no inclination at that time to build
railways designed to serve military purposes, whether
from the point of view of aggression or even from that
of national defence; so that in a letter to his brother Ludwig,
written April 13, 1844, von Moltke, then a member
of the General Staff of the Fourth Army Corps of the Prussian
Army, declared that whilst Germany was building railways,
the French Chamber was only discussing them. This was
so far the case that when, later on, Germany had nearly
3,300 miles of railway France was operating only a little
over 1,000 miles.</p>

<p>Apart from the experiences, on quite a small scale, which
had been obtained on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway,
the earliest example of what railways could do in the transport
of large bodies of troops was afforded in 1846, when
Prussia's Sixth Army Corps&mdash;consisting of over 12,000 men,
together with horses, guns, road vehicles and ammunition&mdash;was
moved by rail, upon two lines, to Cracow. In 1849 a
Russian corps of 30,000 men, with all its equipment, was
taken by rail from its cantonments in Poland to Göding,
Moravia, whence it effected a junction with the Austrian
army. There was, also, a certain movement of German
troops by rail to Schleswig-Holstein in the troubles of
1848-50; but of greater importance than these other
instances was the transport of an Austrian army of 75,000
men, 8,000 horses and 1,000 vehicles from Vienna and
Hungary to the Silesian frontier in the early winter of 1850.</p>

<p>It is true that, owing to the combined disadvantages of
single-line railways, inadequate staff and rolling stock, unfavourable
weather, lack of previous preparations and of
transport regulations, and delays from various unforeseen
causes, no fewer than twenty-six days were occupied in
the transport, although the journey was one of only about
150 miles. It was, also, admitted that the troops could have
marched the distance in the same time. All the same, as
told by <span xml:lang="de">Regierungsrat</span> Wernekke,<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the movement of so large
a body of troops by rail at all was regarded as especially
instructive. It was the cause of greater attention being
paid to the use of railways for military purposes, while it
further led (1) to the drawing up, in May, 1851, of a scheme
for the construction throughout the Austrian monarchy of
railways from the special point of view of strategical requirements;
and (2) to a reorganisation of the methods hitherto
adopted for the transport of troops by rail, the result being
that the next considerable movement in Austria&mdash;in the
year 1853&mdash;was conducted with "unprecedented regularity
and efficiency," and this, also, without any cessation
of the ordinary traffic of the lines concerned.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1851 a further striking object lesson of the usefulness
of railways was afforded by the moving of a division of
14,500 men, with nearly 2,000 horses, 48 guns and 464
vehicles, from Cracow to Hradish, a distance of 187 miles, in
two days. Reckoning that a large column of troops, with
all its impedimenta, would march twelve miles per day,
and allowing for one day's rest in seven, the movement
would, in this instance, have occupied fifteen days by road
instead of two days by rail.</p>

<p>It was in the <i>Italian campaign of 1859</i> that railways first
played a conspicuous part in actual warfare, both strategically
and tactically. "In this campaign," said Major
Millar, R.A., V.C., of the Topographical Staff, in two lectures
delivered by him at the Royal United Service Institution in
1861<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Railways assisted the ordinary means of locomotion hitherto
employed by armies. By them thousands of men were carried
daily through France to Toulon, Marseilles, or the foot of Mont
Cenis; by them troops were hastened up to the very fields of
battle; and by them injured men were brought swiftly back
to the hospitals, still groaning in the first agony of their wounds.
Moreover, the railway cuttings, embankments and bridges
presented features of importance equal or superior to the ordinary
accidents of the ground, and the possession of which was
hotly contested. If you go to Magenta you will see, close to
the railway platform on which you alight, an excavation full
of rough mounds and simple black crosses, erected to mark
the resting-places of many hundred men who fell in the great
fight. This first employment of railways in close connection
with vast military operations would alone be enough to give
a distinction to this campaign in military history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>The French railways, especially, attained a remarkable
degree of success. In eighty-six days&mdash;from April 19 to
July 15&mdash;they transported an aggregate of 604,000 men
and over 129,000 horses, including nearly 228,000 men and
37,000 horses sent to <span xml:lang="fr">Culox</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Marseilles</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Toulon</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Grenoble</span>
and <span xml:lang="fr">Aix</span> by lines in the south-east. The greatest movements
took place during the ten days from April 20 to April 30,
when the Paris-Lyons Company, without interrupting the
ordinary traffic, conveyed an average per day of 8,421 men
and 512 horses. On April 25, a maximum of 12,138 men
and 655 horses was attained. During the eighty-six days
there were run on the lines of the same company a total of
2,636 trains, including 253 military specials. It was
estimated that the 75,966 men and 4,469 horses transported
by rail from Paris to the Mediterranean or to the frontiers
of the Kingdom of Sardinia between April 20 and April 30
would have taken sixty days to make the journey by road.
In effect, the rate of transit by rail was six times greater than
the rate of progress by marching would have been, and
this, again, was about double as fast as the best achievement
recorded up to that time on the German railways. The
<span xml:lang="fr">Chasseurs de Vincennes</span> are described as leaving the station
at Turin full of vigour and activity, and with none of the
fatigue or the reduction in numbers which would have
occurred had they made the journey by road.</p>

<p>As against, however, the advantage thus gained by the
quicker transport of the French troops to the seat of war,
due to the successful manner in which the railways were
operated, there had to be set some serious defects in administrative
organisation. When the men got to the end of their
rail journey there was a more or less prolonged waiting for
the food and other necessaries which were to follow. There
were grave deficiencies, also, in the dispatch of the subsequent
supplies. On June 25, the day after the defeat of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the Austrians, the French troops had no provisions at all
for twenty-four hours, except some biscuits which were so
mouldy that no one could eat them. Their horses, also,
were without fodder. In these circumstances it was impossible
to follow up the Austrians in their retreat beyond
the Mincio.</p>

<p>Thus the efficiency of the French railways was to a large
extent negatived by the inefficiency of the military administration;
and in these respects France had a foretaste, in
1859, of experiences to be repeated on a much graver scale
in the Franco-German War of 1870-71.</p>

<p>As regards the Austrians, they improved but little on
their admittedly poor performance in 1850, in spite of the
lessons they appeared to have learned as the result of their
experiences on that occasion. Government and railways
were alike unprepared. Little or no real attempt at organisation
in time of peace had been made, and, in the result,
trains were delayed or blocked, and stations got choked with
masses of supplies which could not be forwarded. At
Vienna there was such a deficiency of rolling stock&mdash;accelerated
by great delays in the return of empties&mdash;that many
of the troop trains for the South could not be made up until
the last moment. Even then the average number of men
they conveyed did not exceed about 360. At <span xml:lang="fr">Laibach</span> there
was much congestion because troops had to wait there for
instructions as to their actual destination. Other delays
occurred because, owing to the heavy gradients of the Semmering
Pass, each train had to be divided into three sections
before it could proceed. Between, again, Innsbruck and
Bozen the railway was still incomplete, and the First Corps
(about 40,000 men and 10,000 horses) had to march between
these two points on their journey from Prague to Verona.
Notwithstanding this fact, it was estimated that they
covered in fourteen days a journey which would have taken
sixty-four days if they had marched all the way. From
Vienna to Lombardy the Third Army Corps (20,000 men,
5,500 horses, with guns, ammunition and 300 wagons) was
carried by rail in fourteen days, the rate of progress attained
being four and a half times greater than by road marching,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
though still inferior by one and a half times to what the
French troop-trains had accomplished.</p>

<p>On both sides important reinforcements were brought up
at critical periods during the progress of the war. Referring
to the attacks by the allies on <span xml:lang="it">Casteggio</span> and <span xml:lang="it">Montebello</span>,
Count Gyulai, the Austrian General, wrote:&mdash;"The enemy
soon displayed a superior force, which was continually
increased by arrivals from the railway"; and the special
correspondent of <i>The Times</i>, writing from Pavia on May 21,
1859, said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From the heights of Montebello the Austrians beheld a novelty
in the art of war. Train after train arrived by railway from
<span xml:lang="it">Voghera</span>, each train disgorging its hundreds of armed men
and immediately hastening back for more. In vain Count
Stadion endeavoured to crush the force behind him before it
could be increased enough to overpower him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, also, the good use made of the railways by the
allies in carrying out their important flanking movement
against the Austrians at <span xml:lang="it">Vercelli</span> gave further evidence of
the fact that rail-power was a new force which could be
employed, not alone for the earlier concentration of troops
at the seat of war, but, also, in support of strategic developments
on the battle-field itself. Commenting on this fact
the <i xml:lang="fr">Spectateur Militaire</i> said, in its issue for September,
1869:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span xml:lang="fr">Les chemins de fer ont joué un rôle immense dans cette concentration.
C'est la première fois que, dans l'histoire militaire,
ils servent d'une manière aussi merveilleuse et entrent dans
les combinaisons stratégiques.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While these observations were fully warranted by the
results accomplished in regard to concentration, reinforcements
and tactical movements by rail, the campaign also
brought out more clearly than ever before the need, if railways
were to fulfil their greatest possible measure of utility
in time of war, of working out in advance all important details
likely to arise in connection with the movement of troops,
instead&mdash;as in the case of the Austrians, at least&mdash;of neglecting
any serious attempt at organisation until the need
arose for immediate action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>From all these various points of view the Italian campaign
of 1859 marked a further important stage in the
early development of that new factor which the employment
of railways for the purposes of warfare represented; though
far greater results in the same direction were to be brought
about, shortly afterwards, by the American Civil War of
1861-65. Not only does the real development of rail-power
as a new arm in war date therefrom, but the War of Secession
was to establish in a pre-eminent degree (1) the possibility,
through the use of railways, of carrying on operations at a
considerable distance from the base of supplies; (2) the
need of a special organisation to deal alike with restoration
of railway lines destroyed by the enemy and with the
interruption, in turn, of the enemy's own communications;
and (3) the difficulties that may arise as between the military
element and the technical (railway) element in regard
to the control and operation of railways during war. To
each of these subjects it is proposed to devote a separate
chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="smcap">Railways in the Civil War</span></h2>


<p>Such were the conditions under which the War of Secession
in the United States was fought that without the help
of railways it could hardly have been fought at all.</p>

<p>The area of the military operations, from first to last, was
equal in extent almost to the whole of Europe. The line of
separation between the rival forces of North and South was
fully 2,000 miles. Large portions of this region were then
unexplored. Everywhere, except in the towns, it was but
thinly populated. Civilisation had not yet progressed so
far that an advancing army could always depend on being
able to "live on the country." There were occasions when
local supplies of food and forage were so difficult of attainment
that an army might be wholly dependent on a base
hundreds of miles distant from the scene of its operations.</p>

<p>Of roads and tracks throughout this vast area there were
but few, and these were mostly either indifferent or bad,
even if they did not become positively execrable in wet
weather or after a considerable force of troops had passed
along them. In the low-lying districts, especially, the
alluvial undrained soil was speedily converted by the winter
floods into swamps and lakes. Further difficulties in the
movement of troops were offered by pathless forests as large
as an English county; and still others by the broad rivers
or the mountain ranges it might be necessary to cross.</p>

<p>Apart from the deficient and defective roads and tracks,
the transport facilities available for the combatants were
those afforded by coastal services, navigable rivers, canals
and railways. Of these it was the railways that played the
most important rôle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The American railway lines of those days had, generally
speaking, been constructed as cheaply as possible by the
private enterprise which&mdash;though with liberal grants of
land and other advantages&mdash;alone undertook their provision,
the main idea being to supply a railway of some sort
to satisfy immediate wants and to improve it later on,
when population and traffic increased and more funds were
available. The lines themselves were mostly single track;
the ballasting was too often imperfect; iron rails of inadequate
weight soon wore down and got out of shape;
sleepers (otherwise "ties"), which consisted of logs of wood
brought straight from the forests, speedily became rotten,
especially in low-lying districts; while, in the early 'Sixties
lumber, used either in the rough or smoothed on two sides,
was still the customary material for the building of bridges
and viaducts carrying the railways across narrow streams,
broad rivers or widespread valleys.</p>

<p>All the same, these railways, while awaiting their later
betterment, extended for long distances, served as a connecting
link of inestimable advantage between the various
centres of population and production, and offered in many
instances the only practicable means by which troops and
supplies could be moved. They fulfilled, in fact, purposes
of such vital importance from a strategical point of view
that many battles were fought primarily for the control of
particular railways, for the safeguarding of lines of communication,
or for the possession, more especially, of important
junctions, some of which themselves became the base
for more or less distant operations.</p>

<p>The North, bent not simply on invasion but on reconquest
of the States which had seceded, necessarily took the
offensive; the South stood mostly on the defensive. Yet
while the population in the North was far in excess of that
in the South, the initial advantages from a transport point
of view were in favour of the South, which found its principal
ally in the railways. Generals in the North are, indeed,
said to have been exceedingly chary, at first, in getting
far away from the magazines they depended on for their
supplies; though this uneasiness wore off in proportion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as organised effort showed how successfully the lines of rail
communication could be defended.</p>

<p>In these and other circumstances, and especially in view
of the paramount importance the railway system was to
assume in the conduct of the war, the Federal Government
took possession of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore
Railway on March 31, 1861. This preliminary measure
was followed by the passing, in January, 1862, by the
United States House of Representatives, of "An Act to
authorise the President of the United States in certain cases
to take possession of railroad and telegraph lines, and for
other purposes."</p>

<p>The President, "when in his judgment the public safety
may require it," was "to take possession of any or all the
telegraph lines in the United States; ... to take possession
of any or all the railroad lines in the United States,
their rolling stock, their offices, shops, buildings and all
their appendages and appurtenances; to prescribe rules
and regulations for the holding, using, and maintaining of the
aforesaid telegraph and railroad lines, and to extend, repair
and complete the same in the manner most conducive to
the safety and interest of the Government; to place under
military control all the officers, agents and employés
belonging to the telegraph and railroad lines thus taken
possession of by the President, so that they shall be considered
as a post road and a part of the military establishment
of the United States, subject to all the restrictions
imposed by the Rules and Articles of War." Commissioners
were to be appointed to assess and determine the damages
suffered, or the compensation to which any railroad or
telegraph company might be entitled by reason of such
seizure of their property; and it was further enacted
"that the transportation of troops, munitions of war,
equipments, military property and stores, throughout the
United States, should be under the immediate control
and supervision of the Secretary of War and such agents as
he might appoint."</p>

<p>Thus the Act in question established a precedent for a
Government taking formal possession of, and exercising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
complete authority and control over, the whole of such
railways as it might require to employ for the purposes of
war; although, in point of fact, only such lines, or portions
of lines, were so taken over by the War Department as were
actually required. In each instance, also, the line or portion
of line in question was given back to the owning company
as soon as it was no longer required for military purposes;
while at the conclusion of the war all the lines taken
possession of by the Government were formally restored
to their original owners by an Executive Order dated
August 8, 1865.</p>

<p>Under the authority of the Act of January 31, 1862, the
following order was sent to Mr. Daniel Craig McCallum, a
native of Johnstone, Renfrewshire, Scotland, who had been
taken to America by his parents when a youth, had joined
the railway service, had held for many years the position
of general superintendent of the Erie Railroad, and was
one of the ablest and most experienced railway men then
in the United States:&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>McCallum commenced his duties with the staff rank of
Colonel, afterwards attaining to that of Brev.-Brig.-General.
The scope of the authority conferred on him, under the War
Department order of February 11, 1862, was widened a
year later, when he was further appointed general manager<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of all railways in possession of the Federal Government, or
that might from time to time be taken possession of by
military authority, in the departments of the Cumberland,
the Ohio, the Tennessee, and of Arkansas, forming the
"Military Division of the Mississippi."</p>

<p>The total mileage of the lines taken over by the Federal
Government during the course of the war was 2,105, namely,
in Virginia, 611 miles; in the military division of the Mississippi,
1,201; and in North Carolina, 293. Much more was
involved, however, for the Federal Government than a
mere transfer to themselves of the ownership and operation
of these lines for the duration of the war.</p>

<p>One of the greatest disadvantages of the American railways
at the time of the Civil War lay in their differences
of gauge. The various companies had built their lines
with gauges chosen either to suit local conditions or according
to the views of their own engineers, with little or no
consideration for the running of through traffic on or from
other lines. There were, in fact, at that time gauges of
6 ft., 5 ft. 6 in., 5 ft., 4 ft. 10 in., 4 ft. 9 in., 4 ft. 8&frac12; in. (the
standard English gauge), and various narrower gauges
besides. These conditions prevailed until 1866, when the
companies adopted a uniform gauge of 4 ft. 8&frac12; in.</p>

<p>During the Civil War the lack of uniformity was in full
force, and military transport by rail was greatly complicated
in consequence. More than one-half of the lines taken over
and operated had a gauge of 5 ft., and the remainder had
a gauge of 4 ft. 8&frac12; in., except in the case of one short line,
which was 5 ft. 6 in. As locomotives and rolling stock
adapted to one gauge were unsuited to any other, the
obligations falling upon the Director and General Manager
of the Federal Military Railways included that of taking
up the lines of certain companies which had adopted the
5 ft. gauge, and relaying them with the 4 ft. 8&frac12; in. gauge,
so that the same rolling stock could be used as on lines
connecting with them.</p>

<p>Incidentally, therefore, the Civil War in America taught
the lesson that the actual value of rail-power as influencing
warfare in one and the same country, or on one and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
same continent, may vary materially according to whether
there is uniformity or diversity of railway gauge.</p>

<p>In certain instances the lines taken possession of were
in so defective a condition that it was imperatively necessary
to relay them, apart altogether from any question of gauge.
When McCallum was appointed General Manager of Military
Railways for the Division of the Mississippi, the main army
was at Chattanooga, Tennessee, and its supplies were being
received from Nashville, 151 miles distant, over the Nashville
and Chattanooga Railroad. This was necessarily the
main line of supply during the subsequent campaigns from
Chattanooga towards Atlanta, and from Knoxville towards
South-western Virginia; yet McCallum says of it, in the
Final Report he presented to the Secretary of War in 1866:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The track was laid originally in a very imperfect manner,
with a light U-rail on wooden stringers which were badly decayed
and caused almost daily accidents by spreading apart and
letting the engines and cars drop through them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In still other instances, lines which, though begun, were
not finished, had to be completed; in others new lines
had to be constructed throughout, or extensive sidings
provided; so that once more we see that it was not then
simply a question of the Federal Government taking possession
of and operating an existing complete and efficient
system of railways.</p>

<p>Whatever, again, the condition of the lines when taken
over, the railways of both combatants were subjected to
constant attack by the other side with a view to the interruption
of communications, the destruction of railway
track, railway bridges, rolling stock and other railway
property being enormous.</p>

<p>Reviewing the general situation at this time, McCallum
says in his report:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the beginning of the war military railroads were an experiment;
and though some light as to their management had
been gleaned by the operations of 1862 and 1863, yet so little
progress had been made that the attempt to supply the army
of General Sherman in the field, construct and reconstruct
the railroad in its rear, and keep pace with its march, was regarded
by those who had the largest experience, and who had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>become most familiar with the subject, as the greatest experiment
of all. The attempt to furnish an army of 100,000 men
and 60,000 animals with supplies from a base 360 miles distant
by one line of single-track railroad, located almost the entire
distance through the country of an active and vindictive enemy,
is without precedent in the history of warfare; and to make
it successful required an enormous outlay for labour and a vast
consumption of material, together with all the forethought,
energy, patience and watchfulness of which men are capable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To meet the various conditions which had thus arisen,
McCallum was authorised by the Federal Government to
create two distinct departments, destined to bring about
a still further development in the application of rail-power to
war by establishing precedents which the leading countries of
the world were afterwards to follow more or less completely,
according to their own circumstances and requirements.</p>

<p>The departments were known respectively as the "Transportation
Department," embracing the operation and
maintenance of all the lines brought under use by the army
of the North; and the "Construction Corps," which was
to repair the damage done by wrecking parties of the enemy,
maintain lines of communication, and reconstruct, when
necessary, railways captured from the enemy as the Federals
advanced.</p>

<p>Concerning the Construction Corps, and the great work
accomplished by it in keeping the lines open, details will
be given in the chapter which follows.</p>

<p>In regard to the Transportation Department, it may be
of interest to state that this was placed by McCallum in
charge of a General Superintendent of Transportation on
United States Railroads in the Military Division of the
Mississippi. For each of the principal lines there was
appointed a Superintendent of Transportation who, acting
under the control of the General Superintendent, was held
responsible for the movement of all trains and locomotives;
and these superintendents, in turn, had under their direction
one or more Masters of Transportation, whose business
it was to be constantly moving about over the sections of
line placed under their charge, and see that the railway
employés were attending properly to their duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>At each of the principal stations there was an Engine
Dispatcher who was required to see that the locomotives
were kept in good order and ready for immediate use
whenever required, to exercise control over the drivers and
firemen, and to assign the requisite "crew" to each engine
sent out.</p>

<p>Maintenance of road and structures for each line (as
distinct from the reconstruction work left to the Construction
Department) was in charge of a Superintendent of
Repairs, assisted by such supervisors, road-masters and
foremen as he needed to control and direct his working
staff; and maintenance of rolling stock was delegated to
(1) a Master Machinist, responsible for repairs to locomotives,
and (2) a Master of Car Repairs.</p>

<p>These various officers were independent of each other,
and all of them reported direct to the General Superintendent.
The maximum force employed at any one time in
the Transportation Department of the Military Division
of the Mississippi (as distinct from the military lines in
Virginia and elsewhere) was about 12,000 men.</p>

<p>A sufficient staff of competent railwaymen for the operation
of the Military Railways was difficult to get, partly
because of the inadequate supply of such men in the United
States at that period, and partly because those still at
work on railways not taken over for military purposes were
unwilling to give up what they found to be exceptionally
good posts; but of the men whose services he was able to
secure McCallum speaks in terms of the highest commendation.</p>

<p>Having got his Department and Construction Corps into
working order, McCallum had next to turn his attention
to ensuring an adequate supply of locomotives and cars,
with the necessary shops, tools and materials for keeping
them in working order. Here the Secretary of War again
came to his help, issuing, on March 23, 1864, an Order
addressed to locomotive manufacturers in which he stated
that Colonel McCallum had been authorised by the War
Department to procure locomotives without delay for the
railways under his charge, and proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In order to meet the wants of the Military Department of
the Government, you will deliver to his order such engines as
he may direct, whether building under orders for other parties
or otherwise, the Government being accountable to you for
the same. The urgent necessity of the Government for the
immediate supply of our armies operating in Tennessee renders
the engines indispensable for the equipment of the lines of communication,
and it is hoped that this necessity will be recognised
by you as a military necessity, paramount to all other
considerations.&mdash;By order of the President.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In January, 1864, McCallum had estimated that he would
require 200 locomotives and 3,000 cars for the lines to be
operated from Nashville, and towards this number he then
had only 47 locomotives and 437 cars available. There
was thus a substantial shortage which had to be made
good; but the manufacturers, inspired by "a spirit of
zealous patriotism," responded heartily to the appeal made
to them, putting their full force on to the completion of
further supplies. These were furnished with a speed that
surpassed all previous records.</p>

<p>Then, to maintain the locomotives and cars in good
condition&mdash;more especially in view of the constant attempts
made by the enemy to destroy them&mdash;extensive machine
and car shops were built at Nashville and Chattanooga.
Those at Nashville&mdash;the terminal station for 500 miles of
railway running south, east or west&mdash;had, at times, as
many as 100 engines and 1,000 cars awaiting repair.</p>

<p>Next to that insufficiency of engines and rolling stock
which hampered the movements of both combatants came
the difficulty in the way of obtaining further supplies of
rails, whether for new lines or to take the place of those
which had either worn out or been so bent and twisted by
the enemy that they could not be used again without re-rolling.
For the Confederates, cut off by the advance of
General Grant to the south and west from their sources of
supply, the want of iron for new rails was declared to be a
worse evil than was the lack of gold for the Federals.</p>

<p>One expedient resorted to by the Federal Government,
on finding they could not procure from the manufacturers
all the rails they wanted, was to pull up the railway lines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that were not wanted for military purposes and use their
rails for relaying those that were. Altogether the rails
on over 156 miles of track in Virginia and the Military
Division of the Mississippi were thus taken up and utilised
elsewhere. Later on the Federal Construction Corps
erected at Chattanooga some "very superior" rolling mills,
equipped with all the latest improvements in the way of
machinery and mechanical appliances; though these mills
did not actually get to work until April 1, 1865. Their
production of new rails during the course of six months
from that date was 3,818 tons, this supply being in addition
to nearly 22,000 tons which the Federal Government
obtained by purchase.</p>

<p>These details may convey some idea of all that was involved
in the utilisation of rail-power in the American Civil
War under such development of railway construction as
had then been brought about. Great, however, as was
the outlay, the forethought, the energy, the patience and
the watchfulness spoken of by McCallum, the results were
no less valuable from the point of view of the Federals,
who could hardly have hoped to achieve the aim they set
before themselves&mdash;that of saving the Union&mdash;but for the
material advantages they derived from the use of the railways
for the purposes of the campaign.</p>

<p>Some of the achievements accomplished in the movement
of troops from one part of the theatre of war to another
would have been creditable even in the most favourable of
circumstances; but they were especially so in view alike
of the physical conditions of many of the lines, the inadequate
supply of rolling stock, and the risks and difficulties
to be met or overcome.</p>

<p>One of these achievements, carried out in September,
1863, is thus narrated in an article on "Recollections of
Secretary Stanton," published in the <i>Century Magazine</i>
for March, 1887:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The defeat of Rosecrans, at Chickamauga, was believed at
Washington to imperil East Tennessee, and the Secretary [of
War] was urged to send a strong reinforcement there from the
Army of the Potomac. General Halleck (General-in-Chief of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the Army of the United States) contended that it was impossible
to get an effective reinforcement there in time; and the
President, after hearing both sides, accepted the judgment of
Halleck. Mr. Stanton put off the decision till evening, when
he and Halleck were to be ready with details to support their
conclusions. The Secretary then sent for Colonel McCallum,
who was neither a lawyer nor a strategist, but a master of railway
science. He showed McCallum how many officers, men,
horses, and pieces of artillery, and how much baggage, it was
proposed to move from the Rapidan to the Tennessee, and
asked him to name the shortest time he would undertake to
do it in if his life depended on it. McCallum made some rapid
calculations, jotted down some projects connected with the
move, and named a time within that which Halleck had admitted
would be soon enough if it were only possible; this time being
conditioned on his being able to control everything that he
could reach. The Secretary was delighted, told him that he
would make him a Brigadier-General the day that the last
train was safely unloaded; put him on his mettle by telling
him of Halleck's assertion that the thing was beyond human
power; told him to go and work out final calculations and projects
and to begin preliminary measures, using his name and
authority everywhere; and finally instructed him what to do
and say when he should send for him by and by to come over
to the department. When the conference was resumed and
McCallum was introduced, his apparently spontaneous demonstration
of how easily and surely the impossible thing could
be done convinced the two sceptics, and the movement was
ordered, and made, and figures now in military science as a
grand piece of strategy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The feat thus accomplished was that of conveying by
rail 23,000 men, together with artillery, road vehicles,
etc., a distance of about 1,200 miles in seven days. It was
estimated that if the troops had had to march this distance,
with all their impedimenta, along such roads as were then
available, the journey would have taken them three months.
By doing it in one week they saved the situation in East
Tennessee, and they gave an especially convincing proof
of the success with which "a grand piece of strategy"
could be carried out through the employment of rail transport.</p>

<p>In December, 1864, General Schofield's corps of 15,000
men, after fighting at Nashville in the midst of ice and snow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was, on the conclusion of the campaign in the west, transferred
from the valley of the Tennessee to the banks of the
Potomac, moving by river and rail down the Tennessee,
up the Ohio and across the snow-covered Alleghanies, a
distance of 1,400 miles, accomplished in the short space of
eleven days. In 1865 the moving of the Fourth Army Corps
of the Federals from Carter's Station, East Tennessee, to
Nashville, a distance of 373 miles, involved the employment
of 1,498 cars.</p>

<p>What, in effect, the Civil War in America did in furthering
the development of the rail-power principle in warfare was
to show that, by the use of railways, (1) the fighting power
of armies is increased; (2) strategical advantages unattainable
but for the early arrival of reinforcements at threatened
points may be assured; and (3) expeditions may be undertaken
at distances from the base of supplies which would
be prohibitive but for the control of lines of railway communication;
though as against these advantages were to
be put those considerations which also arose as to destruction
and restoration, and as to the control of railways in
their operation for military purposes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="smcap">Railway Destruction in War</span></h2>


<p>One of the earliest and most obvious criticisms advanced
against the use of railways in war was based on the vulnerability
of the iron road. The destruction of a bridge, the
tearing up of a few rails or the blocking of a tunnel would,
it was argued, suffice to cause an interruption in the transport
of troops or supplies which might be of serious consequence
to the combatants prejudiced thereby, though of
corresponding advantage to the other side. By means
of such interruption the concentration of troops on the
frontier might be delayed; an army might be divided into
two or more parts, and exposed to the risk of defeat in
detail; the arrival of reinforcements urgently wanted to
meet a critical situation might be prevented until it was too
late for them to afford the desired relief; a force advancing
into an enemy's country might have its rail connection
severed and be left to starve or to surrender at discretion;
invaders would find that the force they were driving before
them had taken the precaution to destroy their own railways
as they retreated; or, alternatively, lines of railway constructed
to the frontier, and depended upon to facilitate
invasion of neighbouring territory, might&mdash;unless destroyed&mdash;be
of material service to the enemy, should the latter
become the invaders instead of the invaded.</p>

<p>While these and other possibilities&mdash;foreshadowed more
especially in the controversies which the whole subject
aroused in Germany in the 'Forties&mdash;were frankly admitted,
it was argued that, however vulnerable railways might be
as a line of communication, it should be quite possible either
to defend them successfully or to carry out on them such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
speedy repairs or reconstruction as would, generally speaking,
permit of an early resumption of traffic; though
experience was to show that these safeguards could only
be assured through a well-planned and thoroughly efficient
organisation prepared to meet, with the utmost dispatch
and the highest degree of efficiency, all the requirements
in the way of railway repairs or railway rebuilding that
were likely to arise.</p>

<p>The earliest instance of an attempt to delay the advance
of an enemy by interrupting his rail communications was
recorded in 1848, when the Venetians, threatened with
bombardment by the Austrians, destroyed some of the
arches in the railway viaduct connecting their island city
with the mainland. Then in the <i>Italian campaign of 1859</i>
the allies and the Austrians both resorted to the expedient
of destroying railway bridges or tearing up the railway
lines; although the allies were able, in various instances,
to repair so speedily the damage done by the Austrians
that the lines were ready for use again by the time they were
wanted.</p>

<p>It was the <i>American Civil War</i> that was to elevate railway
destruction and restoration into a science and to see
the establishment, in the interests of such science, of an
organisation which was to become a model for European
countries and influence the whole subsequent course of
modern warfare.</p>

<p>The destruction of railways likely to be used by the
North for its projected invasion of the Confederate States
was, from the first, a leading feature in the strategy of the
South. Expeditions were undertaken and raids were made
with no other object than that of burning down bridges,
tearing up and bending rails, making bonfires of sleepers,
wrecking stations, rendering engines, trucks and carriages
unserviceable, cutting off the water supply for locomotives,
or in various other ways seeking to check the advance of
the Northerners. Later on the Federals, in turn, became
no less energetic in resorting to similar tactics in order either
to prevent pursuit by the Confederates or to interrupt their
communications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>For the carrying out of these destructive tactics use was
generally made either of cavalry, accompanied by civilians,
or of bodies of civilians only; but in some instances, when
it was considered desirable to destroy lengths of track
extending to twenty or thirty miles, or more, the Confederates
put the whole of their available forces on to the work.</p>

<p>At the outset the methods of destruction were somewhat
primitive; but they were improved upon as the result of
practice and experiment.</p>

<p>Thus, in the first instance, timber bridges or viaducts
were destroyed by collecting brushwood, placing this around
the arches, pouring tar or petroleum upon the pile, and
then setting fire to the whole. Afterwards the Federals
made use of a "torpedo," eight inches long, and charged
with gunpowder, which was inserted in a hole bored in the
main timbers of the bridge and exploded with a fuse. It
was claimed that with two or three men working at each
span the largest timber bridge could be thrown down in a
few minutes.</p>

<p>Then the method generally adopted at first for destroying
a railway track was to tear up sleepers and rails, place the
sleepers in a heap, put the rails cross-ways over them, set
fire to the sleepers, and heat the rails until they either fell
out of shape or could be twisted around a tree with the
help of chains and horses. But this process was found to
require too much time and labour, while the results were
not always satisfactory, since rails only slightly bent could
be restored to their original shape, and made ready for use
again, in much less time than it had taken for the fire
to heat and bend them. A Federal expert accordingly
invented an ingenious contrivance, in the form of iron
U-shaped "claws," which, being turned up and over at each
extremity, were inserted underneath each end of a rail,
on opposite sides, and operated, with the help of a long
wooden lever and rope, by half a dozen men. In this way
a rail could be torn from the sleepers and not only bent but
given such a spiral or corkscrew twist, while still in the
cold state, that it could not be used again until it had gone
through the rolling mills. By the adoption of this method,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
440 men could destroy one mile of track in an hour, or 2,200
men could, in the same time, destroy five miles.</p>

<p>The most effective method for rendering a locomotive
unfit for service was found to be the firing of a cannon ball
through the boiler. Carriages and wagons which might
otherwise be used by the enemy, and could not be conveniently
carried off, were easily destroyed by fire. In one
period of six months the Federals disposed of 400 in this
way. Stations, water-tanks, sleepers, fuel and telegraph
poles were also destroyed or rendered useless by fire or
otherwise.</p>

<p>In the first year of the war&mdash;1861&mdash;the Confederates
gave the Federals a foretaste of much that was to come by
destroying forty-eight locomotives on the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad, and making a complete wreck of 100 miles
of the North Missouri Railroad track and everything thereon.</p>

<p>Much more serious than this, however, from a strategical
point of view, was the wholesale destruction carried out by
the Confederates, in April, 1862, on the Fredericksburg
Railway, connecting Richmond and Washington, the immediate
result of the mischief done being to prevent an impending
combination between the Federal armies of the Potomac
and the Rappahannock, neither of which could act without
the other, while neither could join the other unless it could
make use of rail communication. There was much that
required to be done, for the Confederates had carried out
their work in a most thorough-going fashion. Several
indispensable railway bridges had been destroyed; three
miles of track had been torn up, the rails being carried
south and the sleepers burned; and wharves and buildings
had been burned or wrecked. The whole transportation
service, in fact, had been reduced to a state of chaos.</p>

<p>At the urgent request of the Secretary of War, the work
of restoration was undertaken by Mr. Herman Haupt, a
railway engineer who had already distinguished himself
more especially as a builder of bridges, and was now to
establish a further record as the pioneer of those Construction
Corps of which so much was to be heard later on in
connection with railways and war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>In carrying out the necessary repairs the only help which
Haupt could obtain, at first, was that of soldiers detailed
from the Federal ranks. Many of these men were entirely
unaccustomed to physical labour; others were sickly,
inefficient, or unwilling to undertake what they did not
regard as a soldier's duties, while the Army officers sent
in a fresh lot daily until Haupt's remonstrances led to their
allotting certain men to form a "Construction Corps."
Other difficulties which presented themselves included an
insufficient supply of tools, occasional scarcity of food, and
several days of wet weather; yet the work advanced so
rapidly that the Akakeek bridge, a single span of 120 ft.,
at an elevation of 30 ft., was rebuilt in about fifteen working
hours; the Potomac Creek bridge, 414 ft. long with an
elevation of 82 ft. above the water, and requiring the use
of as much roughly-hewn timber as would have extended
a total length of six and a half miles, if put end to end, was
completed in nine days;<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and the three miles of track
were relaid in three days, included in the work done in that
time being the preparation of more than 3,000 sleepers
from lumber cut down for the purpose in woods a mile and
a half distant from the track. General McDowell subsequently
said, concerning the Potomac bridge:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When it is considered that in the campaigns of Napoleon
trestle bridges of more than one story, even of moderate height,
were regarded as impracticable, and that, too, for common military
roads, it is not difficult to understand why distinguished
Europeans should express surprise at so bold a specimen of
American military engineering. It is a structure which ignores
all rules and precedents of military science as laid down in the
books. It is constructed chiefly of round sticks cut from the
woods, and not even divested of bark; the legs of the trestles
are braced with round poles. It is in four stories&mdash;three of
trestle and one of crib work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>While constructed in so apparently primitive a fashion,
the bridge was, General McDowell further said, carrying
every day from ten to twenty heavy railway trains in both
directions, and had withstood several severe freshets and
storms without injury.</p>

<p>Thus early, therefore, in the more active phases of the
Civil War, evidence was being afforded that, although the
railways on which so much depended might be readily
destroyed, they could, also, be rapidly restored; and
subsequent experience was to offer proofs still more remarkable
in support of this fact.</p>

<p>On May 28, 1862, Haupt was appointed Chief of Construction
and Transportation in the Department of the
Rappahannock, with the rank of Colonel. He was raised
to the rank of Brigadier-General in the following year, and
did much excellent construction and other work for the
Government, though mainly in Virginia, down to September,
1863. In his "Reminiscences" he relates that the supplies
of repair or reconstruction materials, as kept on hand
by the Federals, included the interchangeable parts of
bridge trusses, in spans of 60 ft., and so prepared that, taken
on flat cars, by ox-teams or otherwise, to the place where
they were wanted, and hoisted into position by machinery
arranged for the purpose, they could, without previous
fitting, be put together with such rapidity that one of his
foremen claimed to be able to build a bridge "about as fast
as a dog could trot." When the Massaponix bridge, six
miles from Fredericksburg, was burned down one Monday
morning, a new one was put up in its place in half a day&mdash;a
feat which, he says, led some of the onlookers to exclaim,
"The Yankees can build bridges quicker than the Rebs
can burn them down." In May, 1862, five bridges over
Goose Creek which the "Rebs" had destroyed were reconstructed
in a day and a half. In the following month
five other bridges, each with a span of from 60 ft. to 120 ft.,
were renewed in one day. At the Battle of Gettysburg
Lee's troops destroyed nineteen bridges on the Northern
Central Railroad and did much havoc on the branch lines
leading to Gettysburg; but the Construction Corps was
hard at work on the repairs whilst the battle was still being
waged, and rail communication with both Washington and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Baltimore had been re-established by noon of the day
after Lee's retreat.</p>

<p>In some instances railway bridges underwent repeated
destruction and reconstruction. By June, 1863, the bridge
over Bull Run, for instance, had been burned down and
built up again no fewer than seven times. Many of the
bridges, also, were swept away by floods, and this even for a
second or a third time after they had been rebuilt. Precautions
thus had to be taken against the destructive forces
of Nature no less than against those of man.</p>

<p>Haupt's pioneer Construction Corps in Virginia was succeeded
by the one set up on much broader lines by McCallum
when, in February, 1864, he became General Manager of
railways in the Military Division of the Mississippi. This
corps eventually reached a total of 10,000 men.</p>

<p>"The design of the corps," wrote McCallum, in his final
report, "was to combine a body of skilled workmen in each
department of railroad construction and repairs, under
competent engineers, supplied with abundant materials,
tools and mechanical appliances." The corps was formed
into divisions the number of which varied from time to
time, in different districts, according to requirements.
In the military division of the Mississippi the corps comprised
six divisions, under the general charge of the chief
engineer of the United States military railroads for that
military division, and consisted at its maximum strength
of nearly 5,000 men. In order to give the corps entire
mobility, and to enable it to move independently and
undertake work at widely different points, each of the six
divisions was made a complete unit, under the command of
a divisional engineer, and was, in turn, divided into sub-divisions
or sections, with a supervisor in charge of each.
The two largest and most important sub-divisions in any
one division were those of the track-layers and the bridge-builders.
A sub-division was, again, composed of gangs,
each with a foreman, while the gangs were divided into
squads, each with a sub-foreman.<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Under this method of
organisation it was possible to move either the entire division
or any section thereof, with its tools, camp requirements
and field transport, in any direction, wherever and whenever
needed, and by any mode of conveyance&mdash;rail, road, with
teams and wagons, or on foot.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>To facilitate the operations of the corps, supplies of
materials were kept at points along or within a short distance
of the railway lines, where they would be comparatively
safe and speedily procurable in case of necessity. At
places where there was special need for taking precautionary
measures, detachments of the corps were stationed in
readiness for immediate action, while on important lines of
railway Federals and Confederates alike had, at each end
thereof, construction trains loaded with every possible
requisite, the locomotives attached to them keeping their
steam up in order that the trains could be started off
instantly on the receipt of a telegram announcing a further
interruption of traffic.</p>

<p>At Nashville and Chattanooga the Federals built extensive
storehouses where they kept on hand supplies of materials
for the prompt carrying out of railway repairs of every
kind to any extent and in whatever direction.</p>

<p>On the Nashville and Chattanooga Railway itself the
Construction Corps, from February, 1864, to the close of
the war, relaid 115 miles of track, put in nineteen miles of
new sidings, eight miles apart and each capable of holding
from five to eight long freight trains, and erected forty-five
new water tanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The reconstruction of this particular line was more
especially needed in connection with General Sherman's
campaign in Georgia and the Carolinas&mdash;a campaign which
afforded the greatest and most direct evidence up to that
time alike of the possibilities of rail-power in warfare, of
the risks by which its use was attended, and of the success
with which those risks could be overcome by means of
efficient organisation.</p>

<p>In that struggle for Atlanta which preceded his still more
famous march to the sea, Sherman had with him a force of
100,000 men, together with 23,000 animals. His base of
supplies, when he approached Atlanta, was 360 miles distant,
and the continuance of his communications with that
base, not only for the procuring of food, clothing, fodder,
ammunition and every other requisite, but for the transport
to the rear of sick and wounded, refugees, freedmen and
prisoners, depended on what he afterwards described as
"a poorly-constructed single-track railroad" passing for
120 miles of its length through the country of an extremely
active enemy. Yet Sherman is said to have made his
advance in perfect confidence that, although subject to
interruptions, the railway in his rear would be "all right";
and this confidence was fully warranted by the results
accomplished.</p>

<p>Early in September, 1864, the Confederate General,
Wheeler, destroyed seven miles of road between Nashville
and Murfreesboro', on the Nashville and Chattanooga
Railway, and in the following December Hood destroyed
eight miles of track and 530 ft. of bridges between the
same stations; yet the arrangements of the Federal Construction
Corps allowed of the repairs being carried out with
such promptness that in each instance the trains were
running again in a few days.</p>

<p>The Confederate attacks on the Western and Atlantic
Railway, running from Chattanooga at Atlanta, a distance
of 136 miles, were more continuous and more severe than
on any other line of railway during the war; but, thanks
again to the speed with which the repair and reconstruction
work was done, the delays occasioned were, as a rule, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
only a few hours, or, at the most, a few days' duration.
One especially remarkable feat accomplished on this line
was the rebuilding, in four and a half days, of the Chattahochee
bridge, near Atlanta&mdash;a structure 780 ft. long, and
92 ft. high. Hood, the Confederate General, thought still
further to check Sherman's communications by passing
round the Federal army and falling upon the railway in its
rear. He succeeded in tearing up two lengths of track, one
of ten miles, and another of twenty-five miles, in extent,
and destroying 250 ft. of bridges; but once more the work
of restoration was speedily carried out, McCallum saying in
reference to it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fortunately the detachments of the Construction Corps
which escaped were so distributed that even before Hood had
left the road two strong working parties were at work, one at
each end of the break at Big Shanty, and this gap of ten miles
was closed, and the force ready to move to the great break
of twenty-five miles in length, north of Resaca, as soon as the
enemy had left it. The destruction by Hood's army of our
depôts of supplies compelled us to cut nearly all the cross-ties
required to relay this track and to send a distance for rails.
The cross-ties were cut near the line of the road and many of
them carried by hand to the track, as the teams to be furnished
for hauling them did not get to the work until it was nearly complete.
The rails used on the southern end of the break had to
be taken up and brought from the railroads south of Atlanta,
and those for the northern end were mostly brought from Nashville,
nearly 200 miles distant.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the disadvantages under which the
labour was performed, this twenty-five miles of track was laid,
and the trains were running over it in seven and a half days
from the time the work was commenced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Concluding, however, that it would be unwise to depend
on the railway during his further march to the sea, Sherman
collected at Atlanta, by means of the restored lines, the
supplies he wanted for 600,000 men, sent to the rear all
the men and material no longer required, and then, before
starting for Savannah, destroyed sixty miles of track behind
him in so effectual a manner that it would be impossible
for the Confederates&mdash;especially in view of their own
great lack, at this time, of rails, locomotives and rolling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
stock&mdash;to repair and utilise the lines again in any attempted
pursuit. It was, in fact, as much to his advantage now to
destroy the railways in his rear as it had previously been
to repair and rebuild them.</p>

<p>All through Georgia, for the 300 miles from Atlanta to
Savannah (where he was able to establish communications
with the Federal fleet), Sherman continued the same tactics
of railway destruction; and he resumed them when his
army, now divided into three columns, turned northward to
effect a junction with Grant at Richmond.</p>

<p>On this northward march, also, there was no need for
Sherman to make a direct attack on Charleston. By
destroying about sixty miles of track in and around Branchville&mdash;a
village on the South Carolina Railroad which formed
a junction where the line from Charleston branched off in
the directions of Columbia and Augusta respectively&mdash;one
of Sherman's columns severed Charleston from all its sources
of supply in the interior, and left the garrison with no
alternative but to surrender. Commenting on this event,
Vigo-Rouissillon remarks, in his "<span xml:lang="fr">Puissance Militaire des
États-Unis d'Amérique</span>":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span xml:lang="fr">Ainsi il avait suffi de la destruction ou de la possession de
quelques kilomètres de chemin de fer pour amener la chute
de ce boulevard de l'insurrection, qui avait si longtemps résisté
aux plus puissantes flottes du Nord. Exemple frappant du
rôle reservé dans nos guerres modernes à ce precieux et fragile
moyen de communication.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>In the aggregate, Sherman's troops destroyed hundreds
of miles of railway track in their progress through what
had previously been regarded as a veritable stronghold of
the enemy's country; though meanwhile the Construction
Corps had repaired and reopened nearly 300 miles of railway
in North Carolina and had built a wharf, covering an
area of 54,000 square feet, at the ocean terminus of the
Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad in order both to
facilitate Sherman's progress northwards, by the time of
his reaching the lines in question, and to enable him to
obtain supplies from the fleet. The railways, in fact, contributed
greatly to the brilliant success of Sherman's campaign,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and hence, also, to the final triumph of the Federal
cause.</p>

<p>The total length of track laid or relaid by the Federal
Construction Corps during the continuance of the war was
641 miles, and the lineal feet of bridges built or rebuilt was
equal to twenty-six miles. The net expenditure, in respect
alike to construction and transportation, incurred by
the department in charge of the railways during their
control by the Government for military purposes was close
on $30,000,000.</p>

<p>From this time the interruption of railway communication
became a recognised phase of warfare all the world over;
and, not only have numerous treatises been written on the
subject in various languages, but the creation of special
forces to deal alike with the destruction and the restoration
of railways has become an important and indispensable
feature of military organisation. These matters will be
dealt with more fully in subsequent chapters; but it may
be of interest if reference is made here to the experiences of
<i>Mexico</i>, as further illustrating the universality of practices
with which, in her case, at least, no effective measures had
been taken to deal.</p>

<p>"How Mexican Rebels Destroy Railways and Bridges"
was told by Mr. G. E. Weekes in the <i>Scientific American</i>
for September 13, 1913, and the subject was further dealt
with by Major Charles Hine in a paper on "War Time
Railroading in Mexico," read by him before the St. Louis
Railway Club, on October 10, 1913. The term "rebels"
applies, of course, in Mexico to the party that is against the
particular President who is in office for the time being; and
in the revolutionary period lasting from 1910 to 1913 the
"rebels" of the moment found plenty to do in the way of
destroying railways not only, as in other countries, in order
to retard the advance of their pursuers, but, also, to spite
the national Government, who control about two-thirds of
the stock in the railways of the Republic.</p>

<p>Altogether, the mischief done by one party or the other
during the period in question included the destruction of
many hundreds of miles of track; the burning or the dynamiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of hundreds of bridges, according as these had been
built of timber or of steel; and the wrecking of many stations
and over 50 per cent. of the rolling stock on the national
lines.</p>

<p>Concerning the methods adopted in the carrying out of
this work, Mr. Weekes, who had the opportunity of seeing
track and bridge destruction in full progress, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Up to the past six months track destruction had been accompanied
either by the use of a wrecking crane, which lifted sections
of rails and ties (sleepers) bodily and piled them up ready
for burning, or by the slower process of the claw-bar, wrench
and pick. But a Constitutionalist expert devised a new system.</p>

<p>A trench is dug between two ties, through which a heavy
chain is passed around two opposite rails and made fast in the
centre of the track. To this one end of a heavy steel cable is
hooked, the other end being made fast to the coupling on the
engine pilot. At the signal the engineman starts his locomotive
slowly backward, and as they are huge 220-ton "consolidations,"
with 22-inch by 30-inch cylinders, one can easily imagine
that something has to give. And it does! The rails are torn
loose from the spikes that hold them to the ties and are dragged
closely together in the centre of the road bed. The ties are
loosened from the ballast and dragged into piles, while in many
cases the rails are badly bent and twisted by the force applied.
A gang of men follows the engine, piling ties on top of the line
and leaving others beneath them. These are then saturated
with oil and a match applied. In a short time the ties are
consumed and the rails left lying on the ground twisted and
contorted into all sorts of shapes and of no further use until
after they have been re-rolled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the bridges, those of timber were saturated with
oil and burned, while in the case of steel bridges rows of
holes were bored horizontally in the lower part of the piers
and charged with dynamite, which was then exploded by
means of fuses connected with batteries of the type used in
Mexican coal mines.</p>

<p>Another favourite method adopted for interfering with
transportation by rail was that of attacking a train, compelling
it to stop, taking possession of the locomotive, and
burning the cars.</p>

<p>There is no suggestion by either of the authorities mentioned
above of any well-organised Construction Corps in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Mexico repairing damage done on the railway almost as
quickly as it could be effected by the destroyers. Mr.
Weekes believed, rather, that it would take years to restore
the roads to the condition they were in before the
rebellion against President Diaz, and he further declared
that it would cost the national lines of Mexico many millions
of dollars to replace the destroyed rolling stock, bridges,
stations, etc.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smcap">Control of Railways in War</span></h2>


<p>Curtailment of the efficiency of railways during war
may be due to friend no less than to foe; and there have
been occasions when, of the two, it is the friend who has
caused the greater degree of trouble, hindrance and interruption.</p>

<p>These conditions have arisen mainly from three causes&mdash;(1)
questions of control; (2) irregularities in the employment
of railway material; and (3) absence or inadequacy
of organisation for military rail-transport purposes.</p>

<p>When the use of railways becomes an essential factor
in the conduct of war, it may appear only natural that the
military authority charged with the duty of furthering or
defending national interests should, through the Government
concerned, have power to command the transport
facilities of all railway lines the use of which may be
necessary for the movement of troops or other military
purposes.</p>

<p>Yet, while the soundness of the principle here involved
is beyond dispute, there is much to be said as to the circumstances
and conditions under which a military control of
railways should be exercised.</p>

<p>It is, in the first place, especially necessary to bear in
mind that the railway, as a means of transport, must needs
be regarded from a point of view wholly different from
that which would apply to ordinary roads. On the latter
any sort of vehicle can be used, and there are, generally,
alternative roads along which traffic can pass, in case of
need. Railroads are not only available exclusively for
vehicles constructed to run upon them, but the degree of
their usefulness is limited by such considerations as the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of separate routes to a given destination; the important
matters of detail as to whether the lines are single track
or double track and whether they are on the level or have
heavy gradients; the number of locomotives and the amount
of rolling stock available; the extent of the station and
siding accommodation; the provision or non-provision
of adequate facilities for loading and unloading; and, in
war time, the damage or destruction of a particular line
or lines by the enemy. The amount of traffic it is possible
to convey between certain points in a given time may
thus be wholly controlled by the physical conditions of
the railway concerned, and such conditions may be incapable
of modification by the railway staffs, in case of a sudden
emergency, however great their desire to do everything
that is in their power.</p>

<p>In the next place, all these physical conditions may vary
on different railway systems, and even on different sections
of the same system. It does not, therefore, necessarily
follow that military requirements which can be complied
with on one line or in one district can be responded to as
readily, if at all, under another and totally different set
of conditions elsewhere; though it is conceivable that a
military commander or officer who fails to realise this fact
may, if he is left to deal direct with the railway people,
become very angry indeed at non-compliance with his
demands, and resent protests that what he asks for cannot
be done at one place although it may have been done at
another.</p>

<p>Then a railway must be regarded as a delicate piece of
transportation machinery which can easily be thrown out
of order, and is capable of being worked only by railwaymen
as skilled in the knowledge of its mechanism, and as experienced
in the details of its complicated operation, as military
officers themselves are assumed to be in the technicalities
of their own particular duties. The Chief Goods Manager
of a leading line of railway who offered to take the place
of a General at the seat of war would arouse much mirth
in the Army at his own expense. It is, nevertheless, quite
conceivable that the General would himself not be a complete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
success as a Chief Goods Manager. In the earliest
days of railways it was assumed that the men best qualified
both to manage them and to control the large staffs to be
employed would be retired Army officers. This policy
was, in fact, adopted for a time, though it was abandoned,
after a fair trial, in favour of appointing as responsible
railway officers men who had undergone training in the
railway service, and were practically acquainted alike with
its fundamental principles and its technical details.</p>

<p>In the operation of this delicate and complicated piece of
machinery dislocation of traffic may result from a variety
of causes, even when such operation is conducted by men
of the greatest experience in railway working; but the risk,
alike of blocks and interruptions and of accidents involving
loss of life or destruction of valuable property must needs
be materially increased if military commanders, or officers,
themselves having no practical knowledge of railway working,
and influenced only by an otherwise praiseworthy
zeal for the interests of their own service, should have
power either to force a responsible railwayman to do
something which he, with his greater technical knowledge,
knows to be impracticable, or to hamper and interfere with
the working of the line at a time of exceptional strain on
its resources.</p>

<p>Under, again, a misapprehension of the exact bearing of
the principle of military control of railways for military
operations in time of war, there was developed in various
campaigns a tendency on the part of commanders and subordinate
officers (1) to look upon railways and railwaymen
as subject to their personal command, if not, even, to their
own will, pleasure and convenience, so long as the war lasted;
(2) to consider that every order they themselves gave should
be at once carried out, regardless either of orders from other
directions or of any question as to the possibility of complying
therewith; and (3) to indulge in merciless denunciations,
even if not in measures still more vigorous, when
their orders have not been obeyed.</p>

<p>Apart from other considerations, all these things have a
direct bearing on the efficiency of the railway itself as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
instrument in the carrying on of warfare; and it is, therefore,
a matter of essential importance to our present study
to see how the difficulties in question had their rise, the
development they have undergone, and the steps that have
been taken to overcome or to guard against them.</p>

<p>It was once more in the <i>American Civil War</i> that the
control problem first arose in a really acute degree.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle adopted for the operation
of the railways taken possession of by the Federal Government
for military purposes was that they should be conducted
under orders issued by the Secretary of War or by
Army commanders in or out of the field. It was for the
Quartermaster's department to load all material upon the
cars, to direct where such material should be taken, and
to arrange for unloading and delivery; but <i>because</i> the
Government had taken possession of the railways; <i>because</i>
the Quartermaster's department was to discharge the duties
mentioned; and <i>because</i> the railways were to be used
during the war for the transport of troops and of Army
supplies, therefore certain of the officers came to the conclusion
that the whole operation of the particular lines in
which they were concerned should be left either to themselves
individually or to the Quartermaster's department.</p>

<p>Among those holding this view was General Pope, who,
on taking over the command of the Rappahannock Division,
on June 26, 1862, disregarded the position held by Herman
Haupt as "Chief of Construction and Transportation" in
that Division, gave him no instructions, and left him to conclude
that the Army could get on very well without his
assistance as a mere railwayman. Thereupon Haupt went
home. Ten days afterwards he received from the Assistant-Secretary
of War a telegram which said:&mdash;"Come back
immediately. Cannot get on without you. Not a wheel
moving." Haupt went back, and he found that, what
with mismanagement of the lines and the attacks made on
them by Confederates, not a wheel was, indeed, moving
in the Division. His own position strengthened by his
now being put in "exclusive charge of all the railways within
the limits of the Army of Virginia," he was soon able<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to set the wheels running again; and from that time General
Pope exercised a wise discretion in leaving the details
of railway transportation to men who understood them.</p>

<p>Then there was a General Sturgis who, when Haupt
called on him one day, received him with the intimation,
"I have just sent a guard to your office to put you under
arrest for disobedience of my orders in failing to transport
my command." It was quite true. Haupt had failed
to obey his orders. Sturgis wanted some special trains
to convey 10,000 men, with horses and baggage, the short
distance of eighteen miles. The railway was a single-track
line; it had only a limited equipment of engines and cars;
there was the prospect of further immediate requirements
in other directions, and Haupt took the liberty of thinking
that he had better keep his transportation for more pressing
needs than a journey to a prospective battle-field only
eighteen miles away&mdash;the more so as if the men were attacked
whilst they were in the train they would be comparatively
helpless, whereas if they were attacked when on the road&mdash;doing
what amounted to no more than a single day's
march&mdash;they would be ready for immediate defence. These
considerations suggest that, of the two, the railwayman
was a better strategist than the General.</p>

<p>Sturgis followed up his intimation to Haupt by taking
military possession of the railway and issuing some orders
which any one possessing the most elementary knowledge
of railway operation would have known to be impracticable.
Meanwhile Haupt appealed by telegraph to the Commander-in-Chief,
who replied:&mdash;"No military officer has any
authority to interfere with your control over railroad.
Show this to General Sturgis, and, if he attempts to interfere,
I will arrest him." Told what the Commander-in-Chief
said in his message, Sturgis exclaimed, "He does,
does he? Well, then, take your damned railroad!"</p>

<p>Haupt found it possible to put at the disposal of Sturgis,
early the following morning, the transportation asked for;
but at two o'clock in the afternoon the cars were still
unoccupied. On the attention of Sturgis being called to
this fact he replied that he had given his orders but they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
had been disobeyed. Thereupon the cars were withdrawn
for service elsewhere&mdash;the more so since no other traffic
could pass until they had been cleared out of the way.
The net results of the General's interference was that
traffic on the lines was deranged for twenty-four hours,
and 10,000 men were prevented from taking part in an
engagement, as they might have done had they gone by
road.</p>

<p>Of the varied and almost unending irregularities which
occurred in the working of the lines as military railways
during the progress of the same war a few other examples
may be given.</p>

<p>One prolific source of trouble was the detention or appropriation
of trains by officers who did not think it necessary
to communicate first with the Superintendent of the Line.
A certain General who did inform the Superintendent
when he wanted a train was, nevertheless, in the habit of
keeping it waiting for several hours before he made his
appearance, traffic being meanwhile suspended, in consequence.</p>

<p>Special consideration was even claimed for officers' wives,
as well as for the officers themselves. On one occasion
Haupt was much disturbed by the non-arrival of a train
bringing supplies which were urgently wanted for a body
of troops starting on a march, and he went along the line
to see what had happened. Coming at last to the train,
which had pulled up, he made inquiries of the engine-driver,
who told him that he had received instructions to stop at a
certain point so that an officer's wife, who was coming in
the train to see her husband on the eve of an engagement,
could go to a neighbouring town to look out for rooms
for herself. At that moment the lady put in an appearance.
She took her seat again and the train then proceeded;
but her side-trip in search of rooms meant a delay of three
hours alike for this one train and for three others following
behind.</p>

<p>The impression seems to have prevailed, also, that officers
were at liberty to make any use of the trains they pleased for
the conveyance of their own belongings. To check the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
abuses thus developed, Haupt was compelled to issue, on
June 25, 1862, the following notice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Assistant Quartermasters and Commissaries are positively
forbidden to load on to cars on any of the Military Railroads
of the Department of the Rappahannock any freights which
are not strictly and properly included in Quarter and Commissary
stores. They shall not load or permit to be loaded any
articles for the private use of officers, or other persons, whatever
their rank or position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Officers, again, there were who, regardless of all traffic
considerations, would order a train to pull up at any point
they thought fit along the main line in order that they could
examine the passes and permits of the passengers, instead
of doing this at a terminal or other station. In still another
instance a paymaster adopted as his office a box car standing
on a main line. He placed in it a table, some chairs, a
money-chest and his papers&mdash;finding it either more comfortable
or more convenient than a house alongside&mdash;and
proceeded with the transaction of all his Army business in
the car. Invited to withdraw, on the ground that he was
holding up the traffic, he refused to leave, and he persisted
in his refusal until troops were called up to remove his
things for him.</p>

<p>Defective arrangements in regard to the forwarding of
supplies were another cause of traffic disorganisation. The
railwayman made from time to time the most strenuous
efforts in getting to the extreme front large consignments of
articles either in excess of requirements or not wanted
there at all. After blocking the line for some days, the
still-loaded cars might be sent back again, no fewer than
142 of such cars being returned on the Orange and Alexandria
Railroad in the course of a single day. If the excessive
supplies so sent were unloaded at the front, they might have
to be loaded into the cars again when the Army moved;
or, as was frequently the case in exposed positions, they
might be seized or destroyed by the enemy. Under a
well-organised system an adequate stock of supplies would,
of course, have been kept in stores or on sidings at some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
point in the rear, only such quantities being forwarded to
the advanced front as were really needed.</p>

<p>At the railway stations there were frequent disputes
between the responsible officers as to which should have
the first use of such troop trains as were available, and
Haupt found it necessary to ask the Commander-in-Chief
to delegate some one who would decide in what order the
troops should be forwarded.</p>

<p>Much trouble arose because, in their anxiety to send off
as many wounded as they could, medical officers detained
their trains for such periods as dislocated the service, instead
of despatching at schedule time the men they had ready, and
then asking for an extra train for the remainder.</p>

<p>In other respects, also, the arrangements for the transport
of the sick and wounded were defective. Telegraphing on
this subject to the Assistant Secretary of War on August 22,
1862, Haupt said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I fear that I may be compelled to-night to do what may
appear inhuman&mdash;turn out the sick in the street. Doctors
will persist in sending sick, often without papers, to get them
off their hands, and we cannot send forward the troops if we
must run our trains to Washington with sick to stand for hours
unloaded. My first care is to send forward troops, next forage
and subsistence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still more serious were the irregularities due to delays
in the unloading of trucks and the return of empties. The
amount of rolling stock available was already inadequate
to meet requirements; but the effect of the shortage was
rendered still worse by reason of these delays, due, in part,
to the too frequent insufficiency of the force available for
unloading a train of supplies with the expedition that should
have been shown, and in part to the retention of the cars
for weeks together as storehouses; though the main cause,
perhaps, was the inability of military men, inexperienced
in railway working, to appreciate, as railwaymen would do,
the need of getting the greatest possible use out of rolling
stock in times of emergency, and not allowing it to stand
idle longer than absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>How such delays interfered with the efficiency of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
railways was indicated in one of Haupt's oft-repeated
protests, in which he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If all cars on their arrival at a depôt are immediately loaded
or unloaded and returned, and trains are run to schedule, a
single-track road, in good order and properly equipped, may
supply an army of 200,000 men when, if these conditions are
not complied with, the same road will not supply 30,000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On July 9, 1863, he telegraphed to General M. C. Meigs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am on my way to Gettysburg again. Find things in great
confusion. Road blocked; cars not unloaded; stores ordered
to Gettysburg&mdash;where they stand for a long time, completely
preventing all movement there&mdash;ordered back without unloading;
wounded lying for hours without ability to carry them
off. All because the simple rule of promptly unloading and
returning cars is violated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the effect of all these conditions on the military
situation as a whole, this is well shown in the following
"Notice," which, replying to complaints that railwaymen
had not treated the military officers with proper respect,
Haupt addressed "To agents and other employés of the
United States Military Railroad Department":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>While conscious of no disposition to shield the employés
or agents of the Military Railroads from any censure or punishment
that is really merited, justice to them requires me to
state that, so far, examination has shown that complaints
against them have been generally without proper foundation,
and, when demands were not promptly complied with, the
cause has been inability, arising from want of proper notice,
and not indisposition.</p>

<p>Officers at posts entrusted with the performance of certain
local duties, and anxious, as they generally are, to discharge
them efficiently, are not always able, or disposed, to look beyond
their own particular spheres. They expect demands on railway
agents to be promptly complied with, without considering
that similar demands, at the same time, in addition to the
regular train service and routine duties, may come from Quartermasters,
Commissaries, medical directors, surgeons, ordnance
officers, the Commanding General, the War Department and
from other sources. The Military Railroads have utterly
failed to furnish transportation to even one-fifth of their capacity
when managed without a strict conformity to schedule
and established rules. Punctuality and discipline are even
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>more important to the operation of a railroad than to the movement
of an army; and they are vital in both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is doubtful if even the Confederate raiders and wreckers
had, by their destructive tactics, diminished the efficiency of
the Union railways to the extent of the four-fifths here
attributed to the irregularities and shortcomings of the
Federals themselves. The clearest proof was thus afforded
that, if the new arm in warfare which rail-power represented
was to accomplish all it was capable of doing, it would have
to be saved from friends quite as much as from foes.</p>

<p>Haupt, as we have seen, suffered much from officers
during the time he was connected with the Military Railroads
in Virginia. He had the sympathetic support of the
Commander-in-Chief, who telegraphed to him on one occasion
(August 23, 1862), "No military officer will give any
orders to your subordinates except through you, nor will
any of them attempt to interfere with the running of trains";
and, also, of the Assistant Secretary of War, who sought to
soothe him in a message which said:&mdash;"Be patient as
possible with the Generals. Some of them will trouble
you more than they will the enemy." But the abuses
which arose were so serious that, in the interest of the
military position itself, they called for a drastic remedy;
and this was provided for by the issue of the following
Order:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
War Department,<br />
Adjutant-General's Office,<br />
Washington,<br />
<i>November 10, 1862</i>.<br />
</div>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Special Order.</span></div>

<p>Commanding officers of troops along the United States Military
Railroads will give all facilities to the officers of the road
and the Quartermasters for loading and unloading cars so as
to prevent any delay. On arrival at depôts, whether in the
day or night, the cars will be instantly unloaded, and working
parties will always be in readiness for that duty, and sufficient
to unload the whole train at once.</p>

<p>Commanding officers will be charged with guarding the track,
sidings, wood, water tanks, etc., within their several commands,
and will be held responsible for the result.</p>

<p>Any military officer who shall neglect his duty in this respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
will be reported by the Quartermasters and officers of the railroad,
and his name will be stricken from the rolls of the Army.</p>

<p>Depôts will be established at suitable points under the direction
of the Commanding General of the Army of the Potomac,
and properly guarded.</p>

<p>No officer, whatever may be his rank, will interfere with the
running of the cars, as directed by the superintendent of the
road. Any one who so interferes will be dismissed from the
service for disobedience of orders.</p>

<p>By order of the Secretary of War.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">J. C. Kelton.</span><br />
</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Commenting on this Order, General McCallum says in
his report that it was issued "in consequence of several
attempts having been made to operate railroads by Army
or departmental commanders which had, without exception,
proved signal failures, disorganising in tendency and
destructive of all discipline"; and he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Having had a somewhat extensive railroad experience,
both before and since the rebellion, I consider this Order of the
Secretary of War to have been the very foundation of success;
without it the whole railroad system, which had proved an
important element in conducting military movements, would
have been, not only a costly but ludicrous failure. The fact
should be understood that the management of railroads is
just as much a distinct profession as is that of the art of war,
and should be so regarded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <i>Europe</i>, Germany and Austria-Hungary were the
first countries to attempt to solve problems that seemed
to go to the very foundations of the practical usefulness
of rail-transport in war. Various exhaustive studies thereon
were written by railway or military authorities, and it may
be of interest here to refer, more especially, to the views expressed
by an eminent German authority, Baron M. M. von
Weber, in "<span xml:lang="de">Die Schulung der Eisenbahnen</span>," published in
1870.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>Railway irregularities peculiar to war service were stated
by this writer to be mainly of three kinds:&mdash;(i) Delays
from unsatisfactory arrangements of the service and from
the misemployment of rolling stock; (ii) temporary
interruption of traffic owing to the crowding of transport
masses at the stations or sidings; (iii) unsuitableness of the
stations and conveyances for the required military services.
The special reasons for the first of these causes he defined
as (<i>a</i>) the absence of sufficient mutual comprehension
between the military and the railway officials; (<i>b</i>) the
strict limitation of the efficiency of individual railway
authorities to their own lines only; (<i>c</i>) the ignorance of
the entire staff of each line with regard to the details and
service regulations of the neighbouring lines; and (<i>d</i>) the
impracticability of employing certain modes of carrying on
business beyond the circuit to which they belong. It
should, however, be borne in mind that these criticisms of
authorities and their staffs relate to the conditions of the
German railway system in 1870, at which time, as told by
H. Budde, in "<span xml:lang="de">Die französischen Eisenbahnen im Kriege
1870-71</span>," there were in Germany fifteen separate Directions
for State railways; five Directions of private railways
operated by the State; and thirty-one Directions of private
railways operated by companies&mdash;a total of fifty-one controlling
bodies which, on an average, operated only 210
miles of line each.</p>

<p>On the general question von Weber observed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The value in practice of mutual intelligence between military
and railway officials has hitherto been far too slightly regarded.</p>

<p>Demands for services from military authorities, impracticable
from the very nature of railways in general or the nature
of the existing lines in particular, have occasioned confusion
and ill-will on the part of the railway authorities and conductors.
On the other hand the latter have frequently declared services
to be impracticable which were really not so.</p>

<p>All this has arisen because the two parties in the transaction
have too little insight into the nature and mechanism of their
respective callings, and regard their powers more as contradictory
than co-operative, so that they do not, and cannot,
work together.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, the nature of the railway service, with its
modifications due to differences in the nature of the ground,
the locality, and the organisation of transport requirements,
is apparent to the military officer, even in a general way; if
he appreciates the fact that the same amount of transport must
be differently performed when he passes from a level line to a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>mountain line, from a double line to a single line, from one
where the signal and telegraph system are in use to one in
which these organs of safety and intelligence are destroyed;
if he can judge of the capability of stations, the length of track,
and arrangements for the loading, ordering and passing of
trains, etc., he will, with this knowledge, and his orders being
framed in accordance with it, come much sooner and with
greater facility to an understanding with the railway executives
than if his commands had to be rectified by contradiction and
assertion, frequently carried on under the influence of excited
passions, or attempted to be enforced by violence.</p>

<p>The railway official, also, who has some acquaintance with
military science, who understands from practical experience
and inspection, not confined to his own line, the capabilities
of lines and stations in a military point of view, will, at his first
transaction with the military authorities, enter sooner into an
understanding with them than if he were deficient in this knowledge,
and will find himself in a position to co-operate, and not
be coerced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the suggestion seems to be that the individual
Army officer and the individual railway executive, or railway
official, should each become sufficiently acquainted with
the technicalities of the other's business to be able to conduct
their relations with mutual understanding. It would,
however, be too much to expect that this plan could be
carried out as regards either the military element in general
or the railway element in general.</p>

<p>The real need of the situation was, rather, for some
intermediary organisation which, including both elements,
would provide the machinery for close co-operation between
the Army on the one side and the railway on the other, guiding
the Army as to the possibilities and limitations of the
railway, and constituting the recognised and sole medium
through which orders from the Army would be conveyed
to the railway, no individual commander or officer having
the right to give any direct order to the railway executives
or staffs on his own responsibility, or to interfere in any way
with the working of the railways, except in some such case
of extreme emergency as an attack by the enemy on a
railway station.</p>

<p>All these problems were to form the subject of much
more controversy, together with much further practical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
experience, in various other countries&mdash;and notably in
France during the war of 1870-71&mdash;before, as will be told
in due course, they were solved by the adoption of elaborate
systems of organisation designed to provide, as far as
possible, for all contingencies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smcap">Protection of Railways in War</span></h2>

<p>The liability of railway lines to interruption or destruction&mdash;whether
by bodies of cavalry sent across the frontier
for that purpose, and aiming at damage on a large scale;
by smaller raiding parties operating in the rear of an advancing
army; or by individuals acting on their own account
in a hostile country&mdash;rendered necessary from an early
date in the railway era the adoption of protective measures
of a type and character varying according to circumstances;
while these, in turn, introduced some further new features
into modern warfare.</p>

<p>Under the orders given by General McDowell for the
guarding of railways in the Department of the Rappahannock,
in the <i>American Civil War</i>, twelve sentinels were
posted along each mile of track; block-houses were constructed
at each bridge, at cross-roads, and at intervals
along the track; pickets were thrown forward at various
points; bushes and trees were cleared away from alongside
the line, and the men at each post had flags and lanterns
for signalling. General Sherman took similar measures to
guard his rail communications between Nashville and
Atlanta.</p>

<p>Precautions such as these were directed mainly against
the enemy in the field; but an early example was to be
afforded of how a civil population may either concern themselves
or be concerned against their will in the maintenance
of rail communication for military purposes. This position
is well shown in the following proclamation, issued July 30,
1863, by Major-General G. G. Meade from the head-quarters
of the Army of the Potomac at a time when attempts to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
throw troop trains off the railway lines were a matter of
daily occurrence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The numerous depredations committed by citizens or rebel
soldiers in disguise, harboured and concealed by citizens, along
the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, and within our lines,
call for prompt and exemplary punishment. Under the instructions
of the Government, therefore, every citizen against
whom there is sufficient evidence of his having engaged in
these practices will be arrested and confined for punishment,
or put beyond the lines.</p>

<p>The people within ten miles of the railroad are notified that
they will be held responsible, in their persons and property,
for any injury done to the road, trains, depôts or stations by
citizens, guerillas or persons in disguise; and in case of such
injury they will be impressed as labourers to repair all damages.</p>

<p>If these measures should not stop such depredations, it will
become the unpleasant duty of the undersigned, in the execution
of his instructions, to direct that the entire inhabitants
of the district of country along the railroad be put across the
lines, and their property taken for Government uses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the Manassas Gap Railway General Auger further
sought to protect Federal army trains against guerilla attacks
by placing in a conspicuous position in each of such trains
some of the leading Confederates residing within Union
lines, so that, should any accident happen to the train, they
would run the risk of being among the victims.</p>

<p>In the <i>Austro-Prussian War of 1866</i> the principle of punishing
the civil population for attacks on the railway lines
underwent a further development. Captain Webber says
in reference to the line through Turnau, Prague and Pardubitz
to Brünn<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>: "The Prussians were fortunate in being
able to preserve the line intact from injury by the inhabitants,
partly by the number and strength of the guards
posted along it, and partly from the terror of reprisals which
they had inspired." Captain Webber suggests that, in the
face of an active enemy, and in a country where the population
was hostile, it would have been impossible to depend
on the railway as a principal line of communication; but
the significance of his expression, "the terror of reprisals,"
as denoting the policy adopted by Prussia so far back as
1866, will not be lost on those who are only too well acquainted
with more recent developments of the same policy
by the same country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>The number of men per mile required for guarding a line
of rail communication is declared by Captain John Bigelow,
in his "Principles of Strategy" (Philadelphia, 1894), to
be exceedingly variable, depending as it does upon the
tactical features of the country and the temper of the
inhabitants. According, he says, to the estimate of the
Germans for the conditions of European warfare, the number
will average about 1,000 men for every stretch of fifteen
miles. At this rate an army sixty miles from its base requires
about 4,000 men for the protection of each line of communication.</p>

<p>With the help of figures such as these one may, perhaps,
understand the more readily how it is that a Commander-in-Chief,
of merciless disposition, and wanting to retain the
active services of every soldier he possibly can in the interests
of an early and successful advance will, by spreading
a feeling of "terror" among the civil population, seek to
reduce to as low a figure as circumstances will permit the
number of men he must leave behind to guard his lines of
rail communication.</p>

<p>These considerations will be found to apply with the
greater force when it is remembered that in the <i>Franco-Prussian
War of 1870-71</i> the Prussians had to adopt an
especially elaborate system for safeguarding their lines of
communication with Germany during the time they occupied
French territory. At each railway station they placed a
guard formed of detachments of the <span xml:lang="de">Landwehr</span>, while small
detachments were stationed in towns and villages in the
neighbourhood. In each signal-box a detachment of troops
was stationed, and the whole line of railway was patrolled
from posts established along it at distances of every three
or four miles. Altogether, the Germans are said to have
employed, on over 2,000 miles of French railway lines
controlled by them, as many as 100,000 troops for protective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
purposes only; and even then the <i xml:lang="fr">franc-tireurs</i> were able
to cause many interruptions.</p>

<p>Under a Prussian regulation dated May 2, 1867, it was
laid down that after the restoration of any lines taken
possession of in an enemy's territory, notice should be given
that in the event of any further damage being done to the
railway, the locality would be subject to a fine of at least
500 thalers, the belongings of the inhabitants would be
liable to seizure, and the local authorities might be arrested.</p>

<p>As a further precautionary measure in the war of 1870-71,
the Germans took a hint from the example of the Union
Generals in the American Civil War by compelling a leading
citizen of the district passed through to ride on the engine
of each train run by them on French soil. In defence of
this practice, the German General Staff say in their handbook
on "The Usages of War"<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Since the lives of peaceable inhabitants were, without any
fault on their part, thereby exposed to grave danger, every
writer outside Germany has stigmatised this measure as contrary
to the law of nations and as unjustified towards the
inhabitants of the country. As against this unfavourable criticism
it must be pointed out that this measure, which was also
recognised on the German side as harsh and cruel, was only
resorted to after declarations and instructions of the occupying
authorities had proved ineffective, and that in the particular
circumstances it was the only method which promised to be
effective against the doubtless unauthorised, indeed the criminal,
behaviour of a fanatical population. Herein lies its justification
under the laws of war, but still more in the fact that it
proved completely successful, and that wherever citizens were
thus carried on the trains ... the security of traffic was assured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Writing under date December 16, 1870, Busch offered the
following justification for the course adopted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They were taken, not to serve as a hindrance to French heroism,
but as a precaution against treacherous crime. The railway
does not carry merely soldiers, ammunition and other
war material against which it may be allowable to use violent
measures; it also conveys a great number of wounded, doctors,
hospital attendants, and other perfectly harmless persons. Is
a peasant or <i xml:lang="fr">franc-tireur</i> to be allowed to endanger hundreds
of those lives by removing a rail or laying a stone upon the
line? Let the French see that the security of the railway
trains is no longer threatened and the journeys made by those
hostages will be merely outings, or our people may even be
able to forgo such precautionary measures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>In the <i>South African War</i>, Field-Marshal Earl Roberts
issued at Pretoria, on June 19, 1900, a proclamation one
section of which authorised the placing of leading men
among the Boers on the locomotives of the trains run by
the British on the occupied territory; but this particular
section was withdrawn eight days afterwards.</p>

<p>The English view of the practice in question is thus defined
in the official "Manual of Military Law" (Chap. XIV,
"The Laws and Usages of War," par. 463):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Such measures expose the lives of inhabitants, not only to the
illegitimate acts of train wrecking by private enemy individuals,
but also to the lawful operations of raiding parties of the armed
forces of the belligerent, and cannot, therefore, be considered a
commendable practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To guard against the attacks made on the railway lines
in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal during the
British occupation, entrenched posts were placed at every
bridge exceeding a 30-feet span; constant patrolling was
maintained between these posts; and the block-houses
introduced (in 1901) by Lord Kitchener were erected along
all the railway lines, at distances of about 2,000 yards.
Each block-house, also, was garrisoned by about ten men,
and each was surrounded by wire entanglements which,
together with various kinds of alarm fences, were also placed
between the block-houses themselves in order both to impede
the approach of the enemy and to warn the garrison thereof.</p>

<p><i>Block-houses</i> are to-day regarded as one of the chief means
of protecting railways against attacks. Their construction
and equipment are dealt with by Major W. D. Connor, of
the Corps of Engineers, U.S.A., in "Military Railways"
(Professional Papers, No. 32, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army,
Washington, 1910).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Supplementary to the adoption of this block-house system,
in time of war, is the practice followed in various Continental
countries, in time of peace, of building <i>permanent fortresses</i>,
in solid masonry, alongside railway bridges crossing important
rivers. In some instances the fortress is so constructed
that the railway lines pass through the centre of it. Not
only, as a rule, are these fortresses extremely solid and
substantial, but they may be provided with bomb-proof
covers and be stocked with a sufficient supply of provisions
to be able to stand, if necessary, a fairly prolonged siege.
One can assume, also, that the garrison would have under
its control facilities arranged in advance for the destruction
of the bridge, as a last resort, in case of need.</p>

<p>The theory is that such fortresses and their garrisons
should be of especial advantage, on the outbreak of war, in
checking any sudden invasion and allowing time for the
completion of defensive measures. Their construction in
connection with all the principal railway bridges crossing
the Rhine was especially favoured in Prussia after the war
of 1870-1.</p>

<p>Similar fortresses, or "interrupting forts," as the Germans
call them, are also built for the protection of important
tunnels, junctions, locomotive and carriage works, etc.</p>

<p>Another method adopted for the safeguarding of railway
lines in war is the use of <i>armoured trains</i>; though in practice
these are also employed for the purposes of independent
attacks on the enemy, apart altogether from any question
of ensuring the safety of rail communication.<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>For the <i>protection of locomotives and rolling stock</i>, and to
prevent not only their capture but their use by the enemy,
the most efficacious method to adopt is, of course, that of
removing them to some locality where the enemy is not
likely to come.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>When, in 1866, Austria saw that she could not hold back
the Prussian invader, she took off into Hungary no fewer
than 1,000 locomotives and 16,000 wagons from the railways
in Bohemia and Saxony. Similar tactics were adopted by
the Boers as against ourselves in the war in South Africa.
On the British troops crossing into the Orange Free State,
from Cape Colony, they found that the retreating enemy had
withdrawn all their rolling stock, as well as all their staffs
from the railway stations, leaving behind only a more or less
damaged line of railway. Subsequently, when the forces
occupied Pretoria, they certainly did find there sixteen
locomotives and 400 trucks; but the station books
showed that in the previous forty-eight hours no fewer
than seventy trains, many of them drawn by two engines,
had been sent east in the direction of Delagoa Bay.</p>

<p>When it is not practicable to withdraw locomotives and
rolling stock which it is desired the enemy shall not be able
to use, the obvious alternative is that measures should be
taken either to remove vital parts or to ensure their destruction.
Certain of the methods adopted during the Civil
War in America were especially efficacious in attaining the
latter result. In some instances trains were started running
and then&mdash;driver and fireman leaping off the engine&mdash;were
left to go into a river, or to fall through a broken viaduct.
In other instances two trains, after having had a good supply
of explosives put in them, would be allowed to dash into one
another at full speed. Many locomotives had their boilers
burst, and wagons were set on fire after having been filled
up with combustibles.</p>

<p>Still another method which has been adopted with a view
to preventing an enemy from using the railways he might
succeed in capturing is that of constructing them with a
<i>different gauge</i>. The standard gauge of the main-line railways
in France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Denmark,
Austria-Hungary, Italy, Switzerland, Roumania and Turkey
(like that, also, of railways in Great Britain, Canada
and the United States), is 4ft. 8½in., allowing trains to
pass readily from one country to the other with the same
rolling stock; but the gauge of the Russian railways is
5ft., necessitating a transshipment from one train to another
when the frontier is reached. Similar conditions are found
in Spain and Portugal, where the standard gauge is 5ft. 6in.<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>Russia adopted her broader gauge so that, in case of
invasion, the invader should not be able to run his rolling-stock
over her lines, as Germany, for instance, would be
able to do in the case of the railways of Belgium and France.
Thus far, therefore, Russia strengthened her position from
the point of view of defence; but she weakened it as regards
attack, since if she should herself want, either to become the
invader or to send troop trains over neighbouring territory
to some point beyond, she would be at a disadvantage. In
the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, when the Russian forces
passed through Roumania on their way to Turkey, the
difference in gauge between the Russian and the Roumanian
railways caused great delay and inconvenience by reason of
the necessary transfer of troops, stores, guns, ammunition,
torpedo boats, etc., at the frontier.</p>

<p>It should, also, be remembered that the reduction of a
broad gauge to a narrow one is a much simpler matter, from
an engineering point of view, than the widening of a narrower
gauge into a broad one. In the former case the existing
sleepers, bridges, tunnels, platforms, etc., would still serve
their purpose. In the latter case fresh sleepers might have
to be laid, bridges and tunnels widened or enlarged, and
platforms and stations altered, use of the broader-gauge
rolling stock thus involving an almost complete reconstruction
of the railway lines. To this extent, therefore, the
balance of advantage would seem to be against the country
having the broader gauge. The conclusion may, at least,
be formed that such a country is far more bent on protecting
her own territory than on invading that of her neighbours.</p>

<p>The course adopted by Germany for overcoming the
difficulty which, in the event of her seeking to invade
Russia, the difference of railway gauge in that country would
present, will be told in Chapter XVIII.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="smcap">Troops and Supplies</span></h2>


<p>In the earlier controversies as to the use of railways in
war, attention was almost entirely concentrated on questions
relating to the movement of large masses of troops,
the saving of time to be effected, and the strategic advantages
to be gained. These considerations quickly passed
from the theoretical to the practical, and when the results
attained were put against such facts as, for instance, the one
that in 1805 Napoleon's Grand Army of 200,000 men took
forty-two days to march the 700 kilometres (435 miles)
between Ulm on the Danube and the French camp at Boulogne,
there was no longer any possibility of doubt as to the
services that railways might render from these particular
points of view.</p>

<p><i>Quicker transport</i> was, however, only one consideration.
There was the further important detail that the movement
of troops by rail would bring them to their point of concentration,
not only sooner, but in <i>more complete numbers</i>, than
if they had to endure the fatigues of prolonged marches by
road.</p>

<p>According to German authorities, the falling-out of
infantry and cavalry when marching along good roads under
conditions of well-maintained discipline and adequate food
supplies averages three per cent. in cool and dry weather,
and six per cent. in hot or wet weather; while in unfavourable
conditions as regards roads, weather and supplies, the
diminution may be enormous. When, in the autumn of
1799, Suvóroff made his famous march over the St. Gothard,
he lost, in eleven days, no fewer than 10,000 men owing to
the hardships of the journey. In his invasion of Russia, in
1812, Napoleon's losses in men who succumbed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
fatigues and trials they experienced on the road were out
of all proportion to the casualties due to actual fighting.
It was, too, a saying of Blücher's that "he feared night
marches worse than the enemy."</p>

<p>An English authority, Lieut.-Col. R. Home, C.B., R.E.,
wrote in a paper on "The Organisation of the Communications,
including Railways," published in Vol XIX. of the
Journal of the Royal United Service Institution (1875):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If an army of moderate size, say 50,000 men, simply marches
one hundred miles without firing one shot or seeing an enemy
the number of sick to be got rid of is very great.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that in a good climate, with abundant
food, easy marches, and fair weather, the waste from ordinary
causes in a ten days' march of such a force would be between
2,000 and 2,500 men, while the number of galled, footsore or
worn-out horses would also be very large. A few wet days or
a sharp engagement would raise the number of both very considerably.
An inefficient man or horse at the front is a positive
disadvantage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another equally important detail relates to the <i>provision
of supplies</i> for the troops and animals thus transported by
rail both more quickly and with less fatigue.</p>

<p>In all ages the feeding of his troops in an enemy's country
has been one of the gravest problems a military commander
has had to solve; and though, in some instances, vast
armies have succeeded in drawing sufficient support from
the land they have invaded, there have been others in which
an army intending to "live upon the country" has failed
to get the food it needed, and has had its numbers depleted
to the extent of thousands as the result of sheer starvation.
This was the experience of Darius, King of Persia, who, in
513 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, crossed the Bosporus, on a bridge of boats, with an
army of 700,000, followed the retreating Scythians, and
lost 80,000 of his men in wild steppes where no means existed
for feeding them. When, also, Alexander the Great was
withdrawing from India, in 325 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, two-thirds of his force
died on the desert plains of Beluchistan from thirst or
hunger. Lack of the supplies from which he found himself
entirely cut off was, again, a main cause of the disaster that
overtook Napoleon in his Russian campaign. Even fertile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
or comparatively fertile lands, satisfying the needs of their
inhabitants in time of peace, may fail to afford provisions
for an invading army, either because of the great number
of the latter or because the retreating population have
destroyed the food supplies they could not take with them
into the interior whether for their own sustenance or with a
view to starving the invaders.</p>

<p>Should the invading army succeed in "living on the
country," the effect of leaving the troops to their own resources,
in the way of collecting food, may still be not only
subversive of discipline but of strategic disadvantage through
their being scattered on marauding expeditions at a time
when, possibly, it would be preferable to keep them concentrated.</p>

<p>General Friron, chief of the staff of Marshal Masséna, wrote
concerning Napoleon's campaign in Portugal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The day the soldier became convinced that, for the future,
he would have to depend on himself, discipline disappeared
from the ranks of the army. The officer became powerless
in the presence of want; he was no longer disposed to reprimand
the soldier who brought him the nourishment essential to his
existence, and who shared with him, in brotherly goodwill,
a prey which may have cost him incalculable dangers and
fatigues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The extent to which a combination of physical fatigue
and shortness of supplies in an inhospitable country may
interfere with the efficiency of an army is well shown by
Thiers ("<span xml:lang="fr">Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire</span>") in regard
to the conditions at the very outset of Napoleon's Russian
campaign. The French troops arriving on the Niemen&mdash;at
which point they were merely on the frontiers of Russia&mdash;were
already overcome by the long marches they had made.
They had no bread, no salt, and no spirits; their craving for
food could no longer be satisfied by meat without salt and meal
mixed with water. The horses, too, were out of condition
for want of proper food. Behind the army a great number
of soldiers dropped out of the ranks and had lost their way,
while the few people they met in a scantily-populated district
could speak nothing but Polish, which the wearied and
famished men were unable to understand. Yet, under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
conditions of former days, it was by troops thus exhausted
by marches of hundreds of miles, done on, possibly, a starvation
diet, that battles involving the severest strain on human
energy were fought.</p>

<p>When "living on the country" is no longer practicable,
the only alternative for an army is, of course, that of sending
supplies after it for the feeding of the troops; but when,
or where, this has had to be done by means of ordinary road
services, it has involved&mdash;together with the transport of
artillery, ammunition and stores&mdash;(1) the employment of
an enormous number of vehicles and animals, greatly complicating
the movements of the army; and (2) a limitation
of the distance within which a campaign can be waged by
an army depending entirely on its own resources.</p>

<p>The latter of these conditions was the direct consequence
of the former; and the reason for this was shown by General
W. T. Sherman in an article contributed by him to the
<i>Century Magazine</i> for February, 1888 (pp. 595-6), in the
course of which he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>According to the Duke of Wellington, an army moves upon
its belly, not upon its legs; and no army dependent on wagons
can operate more than a hundred miles from its base because
the teams going and returning consume the contents of their
wagons, leaving little or nothing for the maintenance of men
and animals at the front who are fully employed in fighting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was, again, the risk when food supplies followed
the army by road either of perishables going bad <i>en route</i>,
owing to the time taken in their transport by wagon, or of
their suffering deterioration as the result of exposure to
weather, the consequence in either case being a diminution
in the amount of provisions available for feeding the army.</p>

<p>All these various conditions have been changed by the
railway, the use of which for the purposes of war has, in
regard to the forwarding of supplies, introduced innovations
which are quite as important as those relating to the movement
of troops&mdash;if, indeed, the former advantages are not
of even greater importance than the latter.</p>

<p>Thanks to the railway, an army can now draw its supplies
from the whole of the interior of the home country&mdash;provided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that the lines of communication can be kept open;
and, with the help not only of regular rail services but of
stores and magazines <i>en route</i> those supplies can be forwarded
to railhead in just such quantities as they may be wanted.
Under these conditions the feeding of an army in the field
should be assured regardless alike of the possible scanty
resources of the country in which it is engaged and of its
own distance from the base of supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="smcap">Armoured Trains</span></h2>


<p>In the issue of the now defunct London periodical, <i>Once
a Week</i>, for August 13, 1859, there was published an article
on "English Railway Artillery: A Cheap Defence against
Invasion," in which it was said, among other things:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We have hitherto regarded the rail merely as a vehicle of
transport, to carry materials which are not to be set in work
till off the rails. If we look at the rail as part of an instrument
of warfare, we shall be startled at the enormous means we have
at hand, instantly available, from mercantile purposes, to convert
to engines of war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The writer was William Bridges Adams (1797-1872), an
authority on railways who had grown up with them, had
introduced into their operation many inventions and improvements
(including the fish-joint still used for connecting
rails), and was the author of various books and papers
on railways, transport, and other subjects. His new idea,
as set forth in the article in question, was specially directed
to the utilisation of railways for defending the shores of
Great Britain against an invader; and in developing this
idea he was, also, as far as can be traced, the first to suggest
the employment of armoured trains.</p>

<p>The immediate reason alike for the writing of the article
and for the making of the suggestion was that in 1859 Great
Britain appeared to be faced by the prospect of invasion by
France,&mdash;a prospect which, in view of the then admittedly
defective condition of the national defences, led to the
creation of the Volunteer Corps, to the appointment of a
Royal Commission to inquire into the question of coast
defence, and to suggestions being put forward by many
different authorities as to what should be done. Among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
those suggestions was one by the writer in question for
supplementing any system of coast defence that might be
adopted by the mounting of guns on railway trucks protected
by armour, such trucks being moved from point to point
along the coast railways to meet, as far as possible, the
needs of the military situation.</p>

<p>Heavy artillery, wrote Adams, though the most formidable
implement of modern warfare, had the disadvantage
of requiring many horses to draw it. So the problem
arose as to how the horses could be dispensed with. This
could best be done, he thought, by putting artillery on
"our true line of defence,&mdash;our rails," and having it drawn,
or propelled, by a locomotive. "Mount," he said, "a gun
of twenty tons weight on a railway truck, with a circular
traversing platform, and capable of throwing a shot or shell
weighing one hundred to one and a half a distance of five
miles. A truck on eight wheels would carry this very
easily, and there would be no recoil." Such a battery
would be "practically a moving fortress," and, used on the
coast railways, which he regarded as constituting lines of
defence, would be "the cheapest of all possible fortresses&mdash;absolutely
a continuous fortress along the whole coast."
Communication with coast railways at all strategical points
should, however, be facilitated by the placing of rails along
the ordinary highways. After giving some technical details
as to the construction alike of coast railways and road
tramways, he proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>With these roads communicating with the railroads, the
whole railway system becomes applicable to military purposes.</p>

<p>The railway system is so especially adapted for defence, and
so little adapted to invaders, that it should become at once a
matter of experiment how best to adapt Armstrong or other
guns to its uses. The process of fitting the engines with shot-proof
walls to protect the drivers against riflemen would be
very easy.... Nothing but artillery could damage the engines
or moving batteries, and artillery could not get near them if it
were desirable to keep out of the way.</p>

<p>One gun transportable would do the work of ten which are
fixtures in forts, and there would be no men to take prisoners,
for no forts would be captured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The more this system is thought of the more the conviction
will grow that it is the simplest mode of rendering the country
impenetrable to invaders at a comparatively trifling cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will be seen that the scheme here proposed included
three separate propositions&mdash;(1) the use of railways, as
"engines of war," for coast defence; (2) the mounting of
Armstrong or other guns on railway trucks from which they
could be discharged for the purposes of such defence; and
(3) the providing of the engines with "shot-proof walls"
for the protection of the drivers. A similar protection for
the men operating the guns on the trucks was not then,
apparently, considered necessary; but we have here what
was clearly the germ of the "armoured train."</p>

<p>Among the other suggestions advanced on the same
occasion were some for the employment of railways in
general for strategical purposes, and more especially for
the defence of London; and here, again, the employment
of armoured trains was advocated.</p>

<p>"A Staff Officer," writing in <i>The Times</i> of July 16, 1860,
declared that the most efficacious and the most economical
line of defence which London could have would be a circular
railway forming a complete cordon around the Metropolis
at a distance of fifteen miles from the centre, and having for
its interior lines of operation the numerous railways already
existing within that radius. On this circular railway there
should be "Armstrong and Whitworth ordnance mounted
on large iron-plated trucks" fitted with traversing platforms
in the way already recommended by W. Bridges
Adams, the trucks themselves, however, and not only the
locomotives, being protected by "shot-proof shields." The
circular railway was to be constructed primarily for strategical
purposes; but during peace the line would be available
for ordinary traffic, and in this way it could be made
to yield at least some return on the capital expenditure.</p>

<p>The writer of this letter, Lieut. Arthur Walker, then an
officer of the 79th Highlanders and the holder of a staff
appointment at the School of Musketry, Fleetwood, followed
up the subject by reading a paper on "Coast Railways
and Railway Artillery" at a meeting of the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
United Service Institution on January 30, 1865.<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> On this
occasion he specially advocated the use of "moveable
batteries" for coast defence in conjunction with railways
constructed more or less within a short parallel distance
of the entire coast line. Field artillery, he recommended,
should be mounted on a truck the sides of which would be
"encased in a cuirass of sufficient thickness," while the
engine and tender would also be "protected by an iron
cuirass, and placed between two cupolas for further protection."
He considered that "to attempt to land in face
of such an engine of war as this would be simply impossible."
Moving batteries of this kind would be "the cheapest of all
possible fortresses.... We have nothing to do but to
improvise well-adapted gun-carriages for our rails." At the
same meeting Mr. T. Wright, C.E., gave details of a proposed
railway train battery for coast, frontier and inland
defence which was designed to carry ten, twenty or forty
guns or mortars.</p>

<p>Another early advocate of the use of railways as an
actual instrument of warfare was Colonel E. R. Wethered,
who, in 1872, wrote to the War Office suggesting that
heavy ordnance should be mounted on wheeled carriages
so constructed that they could be moved along any of the
railways, from point to point. In this way the three-fold
advantage would be gained of (1) utilising the railway
system for purposes of national defence; (2) rendering
possible a concentration of artillery with overwhelming
force at any given spot, and, (3) by the use of these moveable
carriages for the conveyance of the guns, exposing the
men to less risk.</p>

<p>Colonel Wethered further communicated to <i>The Times</i>
of May 25, 1877, a letter on "Portable Batteries" in which
he declared that if, before an enemy could effect a landing,
we were to provide the means of concentrating, with unerring
certainty, on any given points of the coast, a crushing
force of artillery, with guns of heavier calibre than even
the warships of the invader could command, it would be
impossible for the vessels of an invading force to approach
near enough to effect the landing of their men. He continued:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>My proposal is to take the full advantage which our railway
system, in connection with our insular position, affords, and
provide powerful moveable batteries which can be sent fully
equipped in fighting order direct by railway to any required
point; and the recent experimental trials of the 81-ton gun
have proved that the heaviest ordnance can be moved and
fought on railway metals with considerable advantage....
In connection with our present main lines of railway, which
probably would require strengthening at certain points, I would
construct branch lines or sidings leading to every strategical
point of our coast and into every fort, as far as possible, with
requisite platforms.... These branch lines during peace
would, doubtless, be of some small commercial value....
I would mount as many of our heaviest guns as practicable
on railway gun carriages so that they could be moved by rail
from one face of a front to another, and from one place to

<p>He also recommended that guns thus mounted, fully
equipped, and ready for use, should be kept at three large
central depôts which might be utilised for the defence of
London. At each of them he would station (1) Militia and
Volunteer Artillery able not only to work the guns but to
construct, repair or destroy railway lines, and (2) a locomotive
corps specially trained in the working of traffic
under war conditions.</p>

<p>By reading a paper at the Royal United Service Institution
on April 24, 1891, on "The Use of Railways for Coast
and Harbour Defence,"<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Lieut. E. P. Girouard, R.E.
(now Major-General Sir E. Percy C. Girouard, K.C.M.G.),
made what was, at that time, an important contribution
to a subject on which there was then still much to be learned.
Sketching a detailed scheme comprising the employment
of all the coastal railways for the purposes of national
defence, he emphasised the value of Britain's "enormous
railway power" as the strong point of her defensive position,
whether regarded from the point of view of (1) railway
mileage open as compared with the square mile of coastal
area to be defended, or (2) the length of coast line compared
with the railway mileage at or near that coast line, and,
therefore, locally available for its defence. "Why," he
asked, "should we not turn to account the enormous advantage
which our great railway power gives us to concentrate
every available gun at a threatened point in the right and
the proper time, which the proper utilisation of our railways
can and will do, thereby practically doubling or
quadrupling our available gun power?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<p>Whilst the subject had thus been under discussion in
the United Kingdom, America, in her <i>Civil War of 1861-65</i>,
had set the rest of the world an example by actually introducing
armoured-protected gun-carrying trucks into modern
warfare.</p>

<p>Writing from Washington, under date August 29, 1862,
to Colonel Herman Haupt, then Chief of Construction and
Transportation in the Department of Rappahannock, Mr.
P. H. Watson, Assistant-Secretary of War, said:&mdash;"An
armour-clad car, bullet proof, and mounting a cannon, has
arrived here and will be sent down to Alexandria." A
later message, on the same date added:&mdash;"After you see
the bullet-proof car, let me know what you think of it. I
think you ought at once to have a locomotive protected by
armour. Can you have the work done expeditiously and
well at Alexandria, or shall I get it done at Philadelphia or
Wilmington?" The car was duly received; but Haupt's
comments in respect to it, as recorded in his "Reminiscences,"
show that he was not greatly impressed by the
innovation. "P. H. Watson, Assistant-Secretary of War,
sent me," he says, "an armour-clad, bullet-proof car,
mounting a cannon. The kindness was appreciated, but
the present was an elephant. I could not use it, and, being
in the way, it was finally side-tracked on an old siding in
Alexandria."</p>

<p>It would seem, however, that other armour-clad cars
were brought into actual use during the course of the Civil
War.</p>

<p>In the <i>Railway Age Gazette</i> (Chicago) for January 22, 1915,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Mr. Frederick Hobart, associated editor of the New York
<i>Engineer and Mining Journal</i>, writes, from personal knowledge,
of two armoured cars which were in use in the Civil
War. One of these, formed by heavy timbers built up on a
flat car, was put together in the shops of the Atlantic and
North Carolina Railroad Company at Newberne, N.C., in
1862, about two months after the city had been captured
by the Burnside expedition. The armour consisted of old
rails spiked on the outside of the planking composing the
sides and front of the car. Along the sides there were slits
for musketry fire, and at the front end there was a port hole
covered with a shutter behind which a gun from one of the
field batteries was mounted. The second car was similarly
constructed, but was armed with a naval howitzer. The
cars were run ahead of the engine, and were used in reconnoitring
along the railroad line west of Newberne. Mr.
Hobart adds that he was quite familiar with the cars, having
assisted in the design and construction of both.</p>

<p>In the <i>Century Magazine</i> for September, 1887 (page 774),
there is given an illustration ("from a photograph") of an
armour-clad car described as "the Union Railroad Battery"
which was, apparently, used in connection with the springing
of the mine in front of Petersburg on July 30, 1864. The
car is shown to have consisted of a low truck with, at one
end, a sloping armour plate coming down almost to the rails,
and having a hole through which the gun placed behind it
on the truck could be fired. The sides of the truck were
protected from the top of the sloping armour downwards,
but the back was open. The car was, of course, designed
to be pushed in front of the locomotive.</p>

<p>Mr. L. Lodian, also, contributed to the issue of the American
periodical, <i>Railway and Locomotive Engineering</i>, for
May, 1915, a communication, under the title of "The Origin
of Armoured Railroad Cars Unquestionably the Product of
the American Civil War," in which, claiming that "our own
Civil War" originated those cars, he said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Attached is a picture of one in use on the old Philadelphia-Baltimore
Railroad. The illustration appeared in Frank Leslie's
illustrated periodical on May 18, 1864. No better proof could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>be furnished of the authenticity of the fact that such a car
was in use at that time.... There appears to be no great
variation even to-day in armoured car design from the initial
effort of half a century ago. Pictures are appearing in numerous
periodicals, at the period of writing, of those in use by the
European belligerents, and in general appearance and outline
they are about the same as the original, the chief variation in
their use being that the war-going locomotive is also sheathed
in armour, whereas that in use in the sixties was entirely
unprotected, except in front, and then only by reason of the
mailclad car being placed in front to do the fighting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As against this suggestion, there is the undoubted fact
that in the American Civil War the plan was adopted of
having the locomotives of ordinary troop or supply trains
protected by armour-plating as a precaution against attack
when there was no armoured car in front of them. Writing
to the Director of Military Railroads on October 8, 1862,
Haupt said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have been thinking over the subject of locomotives. It
is one which, at the present time, and in view of the future
requirements of the service, demands especial attention. Experience
has shown that on engines men are targets for the
enemy; the cabs where they are usually seated have been
riddled by bullets, and they have only escaped by lying on the
footboard. It will be necessary to inspire confidence in our
men by placing iron cabins (bullet proof) upon all or nearly all
our engines, and the necessity will increase as we penetrate
further into the enemy's country.</p>

<p>Again, it is desirable that the smaller and more delicate
portions of the apparatus should be better protected than at
present, and I would be pleased if you would give to the plans,
of which I spoke to you recently, a careful consideration. It
seems to me that they are peculiarly well adapted to military
service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haupt adds that "protected locomotives and bullet-proof
cabs were soon after provided, as recommended";
and elsewhere in his "Reminiscences" he says, on the
same subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The bullet-proof cabs on locomotives were very useful&mdash;in
fact, indispensable. I had a number of them made and put
on engines, and they afforded protection to engineers and firemen
against the fire from guerillas from the bushes that lined
the road.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71</i> guns mounted on
four armour-plated trucks, fitted up in the workshops of
the Orléans Company, under the supervision of M. Dupuy
de Lorme, Engineer-in-Chief for Naval Construction, were
taken into action on four occasions during the siege of
Paris, namely, at Choisy-le-Roi, for the sortie preceding the
one from Champigny; near Brie-sur-Marne, to support the
Champigny sortie; at Le Bourget, for one of the attempts
to recapture that position; and at La Malmaison, to support
the Montretout sortie. The wagons were protected
by a covering which consisted of five plates of wrought iron,
each two-fifths of an inch thick, and giving, therefore, a
total thickness of two inches. The two engines used were
also protected by armour-plating. One or two of the
wagons were struck by field-gun shells without, however,
sustaining further damage than the denting of their plates.
The engines escaped damage altogether. On going into
action the armoured wagons were followed by another bullet-proof
engine conveying a party of men with tools and materials
to repair any interruption of the lines that might interfere
with the return of the trains; but the only damage
done was so slight that it was remedied in about a quarter
of an hour.<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Further use was made of armoured trains in the <i>Egyptian
Campaign of 1882</i>. One that was put together to assist
in the defensive works at Alexandria is declared in the
official history of the campaign<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> to have "proved most
serviceable." Two of the trucks, fitted with iron plating
and sand bags as a protecting cover, carried one Nordenfelt
and two Gatling guns. A 9-pr. was also placed on one of
the trucks, together with a crane by means of which it could
be lowered out immediately. Other trucks, rendered bullet
proof by sand bags and boiler-plating, and carrying a force
of 200 bluejackets, with small arms, completed the fighting
force. On July 28, the train took part in a reconnaissance
sent out to ascertain the extent of the damage which had
been done to the railway lines near Arabi's outpost. Shots
were fired at the train by the enemy, but without effect.
The reconnaissance was a complete success inasmuch as it
enabled such repairs to be done to the railway as gave the
use of a second line between Ramleh and Alexandria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>So useful had the train been found that it was now further
improved by adding to it a 40-pr. on a truck protected by
an iron mantlet. The locomotive was put in the middle
of the train and was itself protected by sand bags and railway
iron. Thus strengthened, the train went into action
in the reconnaissance in force carried out from Alexandria
on August 5, and "the most interesting incident of the
engagement," according to the official account, "was the
good service done by the 40-pr. from the armoured train."</p>

<p>Early in the morning of September 13 the train, consisting
of five wagons, and having, on this occasion, one Krupp
gun and one Gatling in addition to the 40-pr., was sent to
support the attack on Tel el-Kebir. It was followed by
another train having 350 yards of permanent-way materials,
with all the necessary tools and appliances for the
prompt carrying out of any repairs that might be necessary.
Owing, however, to the hazy and uncertain light and to the
ever-increasing clouds of smoke that hung over the battle-field,
it was impossible to fire the 40-pr.</p>

<p>In the futile attempt made in 1885 to construct a railway
from Suakin to Berber, in support of the <i>Nile Expedition
of 1884-85</i>, resort was had to an armoured train for the purpose
of protecting the line from the constant attacks to
which it was subjected by the enemy. The train carried a
20-pr. B.L., which could be fired only either in prolongation
of the line or at a slight angle from it.</p>

<p>At the Camp of Exercise in <i>Delhi</i> in January, 1886, some
important experiments were carried out with a view to
testing the practicability of firing guns at right angles to an
ordinary line of railway, the result being to establish the
fact that a 40-pr. R.B.L. could be fired with perfect safety<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
broadside from (<i>a</i>) small empty wagons mounted on four
wheels; (<i>b</i>) small empty wagons weighted up to four tons;
and (<i>c</i>) empty eight-wheel bogies. These experiments
were especially successful when account is taken of the fact
that no attempt was made to reduce in any way the energy
of recoil.</p>

<p>Other experiments, begun in 1885, were successfully conducted
during a succession of years both by the French
Government and by private firms in <i>France</i> in the transport
and the firing of guns from railway trucks with a view to
obtaining definite data on the subject, more especially in
relation to firing at right angles to the line.</p>

<p>In <i>Italy</i> a distinguished officer raised the question in the
Italian Parliament, in 1891, as to whether Sicily should not
be defended by means of a coast railway and armoured
trains.</p>

<p>Some experiments carried out at <i>Newhaven, Sussex</i>, in
1894, were the more interesting because the results attained
were due to the combined efforts of Artillery Volunteers
and of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway
Company.</p>

<p>Under the Volunteer mobilization scheme of 1891 there
were some 300 members of the 1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers
to whom no special duties had been allotted, and there
happened to be, at Shoreham, a 40-pr. Armstrong B.L.
gun which was then serving no particular purpose. Inspired
by these two facts, the Secretary of the Committee
for National Defence suggested, in November, 1891, that
negotiations should be opened with the London, Brighton
and South Coast Railway Company with a view to their
mounting the 40-pr. on a specially prepared truck, designed
to form part of an armoured train, experiments in firing
the gun from the truck&mdash;in order to test the efficiency of
this expedient for the purposes of coast defence&mdash;being
afterwards carried out by the Artillery Volunteers whose
services were available for the purpose.</p>

<p>On being approached, the directors of the railway company
readily consented to the fitting up of the truck being
carried out at their engineering and carriage works; they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
contributed towards the expenses, and members of their
staff entered with great cordiality into the scheme, Mr.
R. J. Billington, the locomotive superintendent, being the
first to suggest the mounting of the gun on a turntable to be
fixed on the truck,&mdash;a "bold departure," as it was regarded
at the time, and one expected to produce excellent results.
The railway staff were the more interested, also, in the
proposed experiments because a large proportion of the
members of the 1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers consisted
of men employed at the Brighton Company's works.</p>

<p>In commenting upon these facts, Col. Charles Gervaise
Boxall, the commanding officer, said in a paper on "The
Armoured Train for Coast Defence," read by him at a
meeting of officers and N.C.O.'s of the Brigade, held at
Newhaven Fort, Sussex, on May 14, 1894:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When one considers that a railway company is neither a
philanthropic institution nor a patriotic society, the generous
support given to this experiment by so powerful a body as the
directors of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway
Company is in itself some considerable evidence of the importance
they themselves ascribe to this effort in the direction of the
maintenance of coast defence and protection from invasion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Preliminary experiments with the gun were conducted
on May 5, 1894, and they conclusively showed, Col. Boxall
said, "that the gun will require no traversing to correct
variation caused by the recoil, while the muzzle of the gun
can be directed to any part of its circumference by handspike
traversing within half a minute." He was evidently
proud of the results even of these preliminary trials. They
were the first occasion on which a heavy gun had been
fired broadside on the permanent way of an English railway,
and the truck was the first armour-plated one on which a
turntable, a recoil cylinder, and other inventions introduced
had been employed. So, he further declared:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We do confidently submit that, having proved that such a
gun as this can be mounted so as to be transportable to any
part of our railway system at a moment's notice, brought into
action, and fired with accuracy either end on, broadside, or in
any other direction, without danger of capsizing, and without
injury to the permanent way, we have become pioneers of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>new departure in artillery which must lead to results of the
highest importance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was written prior to the full trials, which took place
at Newhaven on May 19, 1894, in the presence of a distinguished
company of military men and others. An account
of the event will be found in <i>The Times</i> of May 21, 1894.
The gun and its carriage are described as standing on a
turntable platform pivoted on the centre of the truck, and
revolving on a central "racer." The gun detachments
were protected by a plating six feet high round three sides
of the turntable, and the gun was fired through an aperture
in the plating. Drawn by an ordinary locomotive, the
truck on which the gun was mounted was accompanied by
two carriages conveying the Volunteer Artillerymen who
were to serve the gun. Several rounds were fired at a target
some 2,500 yards distant, and "the armoured train passed
through the searching and severe ordeal most successfully,
the jar caused being so slight that a stone placed on the
rails remained unmoved by the firing." The truck, it is
further stated, had been provided with some cross girders
which could be run out and supported on blocks in order
to secure a broad base when the gun was fired at right angles
to the line, and there was a further arrangement for connecting
the truck to the rails by strong clips; but the truck
remained sufficiently steady without any need for making
use of these appliances.</p>

<p>Finally, as will be told more fully in Chapter XVI, the
<i>South African Campaign of 1899-1902</i> definitely established
the usefulness of armoured trains as an "instrument of
war," and led both to the creation of an efficient organisation
for their employment on the most scientific and most
practical lines and to the establishment of certain principles
in regard to such important matters of detail as uses and
purposes, administration, staff, armament, tactics, etc.
Published in the "Detailed History of the Railways in the
South African War" which was issued by the Royal Engineers'
Institute, Chatham, in 1905, these principles were
adopted in the <i>United States</i> with modifications to suit
American conditions, and, so modified, are reproduced in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Major William D. Connor's handbook on "Military Railways,"
forming No. 32 of the Professional Papers of the
Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army. An excellent treatment of
the subject, from a technical point of view, will be found
in a paper, by Capt. H. O. Nance, on "Armoured Trains,"
published, with photographs and drawings, in "Papers of
the Corps of Royal Engineers," Fourth Series, Vol. I.,
Paper 4 (Chatham, 1906).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="smcap">Railway Ambulance Transport</span></h2>


<p>According to statistics which have been compiled in
relation to wars alike in ancient and in modern times, for
every ten men among the armies in the field who have
died from wounds received in battle there have been from
thirty-five to forty who died from sickness or disease.
Writing in the <i xml:lang="fr">Journal des Sciences Militaires</i>, Dr. Morache,
a surgeon in the French Army, has said that while the total
number of deaths among combatants taking part in the
Crimean War was 95,000, no fewer than 70,000 were due
to typhus, scurvy, cholera or other diseases. In the Italian
campaign of 1859 the French lost 5,498 men, of whom 2,500
died from sickness. On the conclusion of the Russo-Turkish
War the Russians had 51,000 of their troops sick,
the ravages of typhus having been especially severe.</p>

<p>These conditions have been materially aggravated by
the gathering together of great numbers of sick and wounded
into overcrowded hospitals situate on or near to the theatre
of war and destined inevitably to become hot-beds of disease
and pestilence far more dangerous to human life, under
these conditions, than even the most deadly weapons which
the art of war had invented for use on the battle-field itself.</p>

<p>Nor was it the armies alone that suffered. Returning
troops spread the seeds of disease among the civil population,
causing epidemics that lingered, in some instances, for
several years and carried off many thousands of non-combatants,
in addition to the great number of victims among
the combatants themselves. In a volume of 866 pages,
published by Dr. E. Gurlt, under the title of "<span xml:lang="de">Zur Geschichte
der Internationellen und Freiwilligen Krankenpflege im
Kriege</span>" (Leipzig, 1873), will be found many terrible details<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
concerning the ravages in France, Germany and Austria of
the typhus which Napoleon's troops brought back with
them on the occasion of their disastrous retreat from Russia.</p>

<p>The most practicable means of mitigating, if not of
avoiding, these various evils is to be found in the prompt
removal of the sick and wounded from the theatre of war,
and their distribution in smaller units, not simply among a
group of neighbouring towns, but over an area extending to
considerable distances inland. The adoption of this remedy
only became possible, however, with a provision of adequate
rail facilities, and even then many years were to elapse
before an efficient system of railway ambulance transport
was finally evolved.</p>

<p>The objects which the use of the railway in these directions
was to attain were alike humanitarian and strategical.</p>

<p>To the sick and wounded among the troops, prompt
removal and widespread distribution among hospitals in
the interior meant (1) that they avoided the risks to which
they would have been subjected in the aforesaid overcrowded
and pestilential hospitals near the fighting line, where
slight injuries might readily develop dangerous symptoms,
and contagious disease complete the conditions leading to a
fatal issue; (2) that, apart from these considerations, it
would be possible to give them a greater degree of individual
attention if they were distributed among a large number of
hospitals away from the scene of the fighting; (3) that
more conservative methods of surgery became practicable
when operations of a kind not to be attempted either on
the battle-field or in temporary hospitals (from which the
inmates might have to be suddenly removed, owing to some
change in the strategical position) could be delayed until
the sufferer's arrival at some hospital in the interior, where
better appliances and better facilities would be available,
and where, after the operation, the patient would be able
to remain undisturbed until he was cured; (4) that these
improved conditions might more especially permit of
the avoidance of amputations otherwise imperatively
necessary; and (5) that, on the whole, the wounded soldier
was afforded a better chance of effecting a speedy recovery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and of saving both life and limb than would be possible if
railways were not available.</p>

<p>To the army in the field the innovation meant that with
the speedy removal of the sick and wounded it would be
relieved of the great source of embarrassment caused by
the presence and dependence upon it of so many inefficients;<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
depôt and intermediate hospitals could be reduced to the
smallest proportions, and would thus occasion less inconvenience
if, owing to a retreat or a change in the strategical
position, they were brought within the sphere of military
operations; with the delegation of so many of the sick and
wounded to the care of civil practitioners in the interior,
fewer of the divisional, brigade and regimental medical
officers would require to be detached from the marching
column; a smaller supplementary medical staff would
suffice; a considerable reduction could be effected in the
stocks of ambulance supplies kept on hand at the front;
while important strategical advantages would be gained
through (1) the greater freedom of movement which the
army would secure; (2) the decreased risk of the number
of efficients being reduced through the outbreak of epidemics;
and (3) the prospect of a large proportion of the
sick and wounded being enabled to rejoin the fighting
force on their making a speedy recovery from their illness
or their wounds.</p>

<p>The earliest occasion on which the railway was made use
of for the conveyance of sick and wounded from a scene
of actual hostilities to the rear was on the occasion of the
<i>Crimean War</i>, when the little military line between Balaklava
and the camp before Sebastopol, of which an account will
be given in Chapter XV, was so employed. The facilities
afforded were, however, of the most primitive character.
Only the wagons used for the transport of supplies to the
front&mdash;wagons, that is to say, little better than those
known as "contractors' trucks"&mdash;were available, and there
were no means of adapting them to the conveyance of
sufferers who could not be moved otherwise than in a recumbent
position. Sitting-up cases could, therefore, alone be
carried; but what was to develop into a revolution in the
conditions of warfare was thus introduced, all the same.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>In the <i>Italian war of 1859</i> both the French and the Austrians
made use of the railways for the withdrawal of their
sick and wounded, and, in his "<span xml:lang="fr">Souvenir de Solferino</span>,"
Jean Henri Dumant, the "Father" of the Red Cross Movement,
speaks of the transportation of wounded from Brescia
to Milan by train to the extent of about 1,000 a night.
No arrangements for their comfort on the journey had been
made in advance, and the changes in the military situation
were so rapid, when hostilities broke out, that no special
facilities could be provided then. All that was done was to
lay down straw on the floor of the goods or cattle trucks
used for the conveyance of some of the more serious cases.
The remainder travelled in ordinary third-class carriages,
and their sufferings on the journey, before they reached
the long and narrow sheds put up along the railway lines
at Milan or elsewhere to serve as temporary hospitals, must
often have been very great. They may, nevertheless, have
escaped the fate of those who died, not from their wounds,
but from the fevers quickly generated in the overcrowded
hospitals at the front, where there was, besides, a general
deficiency of ambulance requirements of all kinds. The
good resulting from the removal by train is, indeed, said
to have been "immense."</p>

<p>These experiences in the campaign of 1859 led to a recommendation
being made in the following year by a <i>German</i>
medical authority, Dr. E. Gurlt,<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that railway vehicles
should be specially prepared for the conveyance of the
sick and wounded in time of war. The plan which he
himself suggested for adoption was the placing of the
sufferers in hammocks suspended from hooks driven into
the roof of the goods van or carriage employed, mattresses
being first put on the hammocks, when necessary. By this
means, he suggested, the sufferers would travel much more
comfortably than when seated in the ordinary passenger
carriages, or when lying on straw in the goods wagons or
cattle trucks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>Dr. Gurlt's pamphlet served the good purpose of drawing
much attention to the subject, and his proposals were duly
subjected to the test of experiment. They failed, however,
on two grounds,&mdash;(1) because the roofs of the goods vans,
designed for shelter only, were not sufficiently strong to
bear the weight of a number of men carried in the way
suggested; and (2) because the motion of the train caused
the hammocks to come into frequent contact with the sides
of the wagon, to the serious discomfort of the occupants.</p>

<p>In November of the same year (1860) the Prussian War
Minister, von Roon, appointed a Commission to enquire
into the whole subject of the care of the sick and wounded
in time of war, and the question of transport by rail was
among the various matters considered. As a result of
these investigations, the Minister issued, on July 1, 1861,
an order to the effect that in future the less seriously wounded
should travel in ordinary first, second or third-class carriages,
according to the degree of comfort they required, care being
taken to let them have corner seats; while for those who
were seriously ill, or badly wounded, there were to be provided
sacks of straw having three canvas loops on each side
for the insertion of poles by means of which the sacks and the
sufferers lying upon them could be readily lifted in or out
of the goods wagons set apart for their conveyance. In
these wagons they were to be placed on the floor in such a
way that each wagon would accommodate either seven or
eight. In the event of a deficiency of sacks, loose straw
was to be used instead. The door on one side of the truck
was to be left open for ventilation. A doctor and attendants
were to accompany each train, and they were to have
a supply of bandages, medicines and appliances. Of the
last-mentioned a list of five articles was appended as obligatory.
The medical officer was to visit the wagons during
the stoppages, and the attendants on duty in the wagons
were to carry flags so that, when necessary, they could signal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
both for the train to pull up and for the doctor to come to
the sufferers.</p>

<p>This was as far as Prussia had got by 1861, when the
arrangements stated were regarded as quite sufficient to
meet the requirements of the situation. Real progress was
to come, rather, from the other side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>In the early days of the <i>War of Secession</i> (1861-65) the
arrangements for the conveyance by rail of the sick and
wounded from the battle-fields of the Eastern States to the
hospitals in the large cities were still distinctly primitive.
Those who could sit up in the ordinary cars were conveyed
in them. Those who could not sit up, or would be injured
by so doing, were carried to the railway, by hand, on the
mattresses or stretchers they had occupied in the hospitals
to which they had first been taken. At the station the
mattresses were placed on thick layers of straw or hay
strewn over the floors of the freight cars in which supplies
had been brought to the front. Large window spaces were
cut in the sides or ends of the cars to provide for ventilation.
On some occasions, when hay or straw was not available,
pine boughs or leaves were used instead. As only the floor
space was occupied no more than about ten patients could
be carried comfortably in each car, though as many as
twenty were occasionally crowded in. The wide doors of
the box cars readily permitted of the beds being lifted in
or out. Medical officers, with supplies, accompanied each
train. On arrival at New York, Washington, Philadelphia,
Harrisburg, or other destination, the sufferers were taken
out and carried, still on the same mattresses or stretchers,
to the hospitals there.</p>

<p>Large numbers of sick or wounded were conveyed by rail
under one or other of these conditions, and the work was
done with great expedition. Between the morning of
June 12 and the evening of June 14, 1863, over 9,000 wounded,
victims of the Federal disaster at Chancellorsville, were
taken by the single-track Aquia Creek railroad from Aquia
Creek to Washington. Many even of the severely wounded
declared they had suffered no inconvenience from the
journey. After the battle of Gettysburg, July 1-3, 1863,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
more than 15,000 wounded had been sent by rail from the
field hospitals to Baltimore, New York, Harrisburg or
Philadelphia by July 22. An even more rapid distribution
was effected after the battles of the Wilderness and Spottsylvania
when, with a few exceptions, the transfer to the
hospitals in the cities mentioned was effected in the course
of a few days. Following on the battle of Olustree (February
20, 1864), the serious cases were removed on the Mobile
Railway by freight cars bedded with pine boughs, palmetto
leaves and a small quantity of straw, each patient having
a blanket, in addition.</p>

<p>As an improvement on these methods of transport, the
plan was adopted of fixing rows of upright wooden posts,
connecting floor and ceiling, on each side of a car as supports
for two or three tiers of rough wooden bunks, a central
gangway through the car being left. In this way the available
space in the car was much better utilised than with
the straw-on-floor system. Next, in place of the bunks,
came an arrangement by which the stretchers whereon the
patients lay could be securely lashed to the uprights; while
this was followed, in turn, by the insertion of wooden pegs
into the uprights and the placing on them of large and
strong india-rubber rings into which the handles of the
stretchers could readily be slipped, and so suspended. The
first car so arranged came into use in March, 1863.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Philadelphia Railroad Company had, at
the end of 1862, fitted up an ambulance car on the principle
of a sleeping car, but so planned that the stretchers on which
the sufferers lay could be made to slide in or out of the
wooden supports. This particular car was capable of
accommodating fifty-one patients, in addition to a seat at
each end for an attendant. Other innovations introduced
on the car were (1) a stove at which soups could be
warmed or tea made; (2) a water tank, and (3) a locker.</p>

<p>What the introducers of these improvements mainly
prided themselves upon was the fact that the patient could
remain, throughout the entire journey from field hospital
to destination, on the stretcher he had been placed on at
the start. The adoption of this principle necessitated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
however, uniformity in the dimensions of the stretchers in
order that these could always be accommodated on the
ambulance-car fittings.</p>

<p>The next important development was reached when the
ambulance <i>car</i>, run in connection with ordinary trains,
and used for exceptionally severe cases, was succeeded by the
ambulance <i>train</i>. Here came further innovations, the nine
or ten "ward-cars," of which such a train mainly consisted
in the Eastern States, being supplemented by others fitted
up as dispensary and store-room, kitchen, and quarters
for surgeon, attendants, and staff of train, besides carrying
all necessary appliances and provisions for the
journey.</p>

<p>What was now specially aimed at was to make the train
as close an approach to an actual hospital on wheels as
circumstances would permit. "At present," wrote the
Medical Director of the Department of Washington, "the
sick and wounded are transferred in cars ill-adapted for
the purpose and with difficulty spared from the other
pressing demands; and lives are lost on the route not infrequently
which, in all probability, might be saved by a
more comfortable and easy method of transportation."
The train he caused to be constructed consisted of ten
ward-cars, one car for the surgeon and attendants, one as a
dispensary and store-room, and one as a kitchen, etc. The
ward-cars, arranged on an improved principle, each accommodated
thirty recumbent and twenty or thirty seated
patients. The train was to run regularly on the Orange
and Alexandria Railroad between the theatre of war and
the base hospitals at Alexandria and Washington. It was
either to supplement or to supersede the freight cars with
their bedding of straw, hay or leaves. If only from the
point of view of the inadequate supply of rolling stock, a
car fitted up to accommodate fifty or sixty patients offered
an obvious advantage, in the speedy removal and distribution
of sick and wounded, over a car, without fittings, in which
the floor space alone could be utilised.</p>

<p>Several complete trains of the type stated were soon
running on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, within<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the Union lines, and the hospital train thus became an
established institution in modern warfare.</p>

<p>It was, however, in connection with the chief army in the
West, the Army of the Cumberland, operating under General
George H. Thomas, that the useful purposes which could
be served by hospital trains became most conspicuous.</p>

<p>The need for them in the West was even greater than in
the East, because the distances to be covered were greater
and lay, also, to a considerable extent, in enemy country.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1863 and the winter of 1864, as narrated in
the "Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion,"
the chief army of the West was concentrated principally
along the line of railroads leading from Nashville,
Tennessee, to the South-west, viâ Chattanooga, Tenn., and
onwards towards Atlanta, Georgia. At the outset the sick
and wounded who could travel in ordinary passenger cars
to points in the North were so taken. Severe cases had
to remain in the nearest available hospital depôt. In
addition to the discomfort suffered by the former in having
to travel in cars not suited to invalids, they were liable to
frequent and prolonged delays on the single-track lines by
reason of the constant passing of supply trains proceeding
to the front; and not unfrequently the detentions were at
points where nothing could be obtained for feeding the
sufferers or making them comfortable, while even if rations
could be drawn the train afforded no means of cooking
them. So it was resolved to have a train which would be
the equivalent of an ambulating, self-contained hospital,
capable of carrying both recumbent and sitting-up patients
and supplying all their wants on the journey.</p>

<p>On August 11, 1863, instructions were sent from the
Assistant-Surgeon-General's Office to the Medical Officer
of the Army of the Cumberland directing him "to take
immediate measures to fit up a special train for hospital
purposes, with every possible comfort," to run between
Nashville, Ten., and Louisville, Ken. General Thomas,
in turn, accorded the fullest authority to the Medical
Officer to select for the purpose the best locomotives and
the best cars to be found among the railway rolling stock,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and to have new cars fitted up whenever necessary. He
further directed that the most experienced drivers, conductors
and other necessary railway employés should be
selected for the conduct of the hospital-train service.</p>

<p>Three of these trains were ready by the spring of 1864,
and they ran regularly&mdash;each taking a section of the journey&mdash;between
Atlanta and Louisville, a distance of 472 miles.
They consisted, apparently, in part of specially-built and
in part of adapted rolling stock, the large open American
passenger cars, with their greater freedom from internal
fittings than ordinary European railway carriages, lending
themselves specially to the purpose. In the converted
passenger cars the carrying of the stretchers through the
end doors was avoided by removing two windows and the
panelling underneath them from the side of the car, and
making an opening 6 ft. in width which could be closed by
a sliding door. Each train provided five ward-cars (converted
passenger cars) for lying-down patients; a surgeon's
car (a passenger car from which the seats had been removed,
with partitions and fittings for the accommodation of the
doctor and his helpers); a dispensary car (in which an ample
supply of medicines, instruments and appliances was carried);
an ordinary passenger car for sitting-up patients
or convalescents; a kitchen car (divided into kitchen,
dining-room and store-room); and a conductor's car. The
kitchen car was supplied with a small cooking range, boilers,
and other requisites for the feeding of from 175 to 200
patients. The cars were warmed and lighted in winter,
and special attention was paid to ventilation, so that Dr. F.
L. Town, of the United States Army, was able to report
of them:&mdash;"In visiting these hospital trains, the air is
found sweet and pure, the wards are neat and inviting; and
it may unhesitatingly be said that men on hospital trains
are often as comfortable and better fed and attended than
in many permanent hospitals." The trains had distinguishing
signals which were recognised by the Confederates,
and none of them were ever fired on or molested in any way.</p>

<p>One, at least, of the trains was despatched daily from the
vicinity of the field hospitals. The services rendered by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
them during the last eighteen months of the war were of
the greatest value. It has been said, indeed, that the combined
effect of all the provision made for the care of the
sick and wounded and their speedy recovery&mdash;including
therein, as one of the most important items, their prompt
removal and distribution by rail&mdash;was to ensure for the
Federals the retention of a force equal in itself to an army
of 100,000 men. No single fact could show more conclusively
the <i>strategical</i> as well as the humanitarian value
of railway ambulance transport.</p>

<p>These details as to what was accomplished in the American
Civil War are the more deserving of record because they
show that the evolution of the "hospital on wheels," from the
initial conditions of a bedding of straw on the floor of a
railway goods wagon, was really carried out, step by step,
in all its essential details, in the United States. The hospital
train was thus <i>not</i> an English invention, as is widely
assumed to be the case; though much was to be done here
to improve its construction, equipment and organisation.</p>

<p>Whilst America had been gaining all this very practical
experience, the <i>Danish War of 1864</i> had given Prussia the
opportunity of testing the system approved by her in 1861
for the conveyance of the less severely wounded in ordinary
passenger carriages and of the seriously wounded on sacks
of straw laid on the floor of goods wagons. The results
were found so unsatisfactory that on the conclusion of
hostilities a fresh series of investigations and experiments
was begun, and matters were still at this stage when war
broke out between Prussia and Austria.</p>

<p>The conditions in regard to the care of the sick and wounded
in the <i>campaign of 1866</i> were deplorably defective. Not
only, according to Dr. T. W. Evans<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;an American medical
man, settled in Paris, who visited the battle-field and assisted
in the work of relief&mdash;was there no advance on what had
been done in the United States, but the American example
was in no way followed, the combatants having made no
attempt whatever to profit from her experience.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>After the battle of Sadowa, thousands of wounded were
left on the battle-field, and many remained there three
days and three nights before they could be removed in the
carts and wagons which were alone available for the purpose.
Within five days every village in a radius of four
leagues was crowded with wounded. Those taken to
Dresden and Prague in ordinary passenger carriages or
goods vans were detained for days on the journey owing to
the congestion of traffic on the lines. Some of them, also,
were in the trains for two days before their wounds were
dressed. Then the use of straw, depended on by the
Austrians, was found to be unsatisfactory. It failed to
afford the sufferers a sufficient protection against the jolting
of the wagons, especially when they worked through it to
the bare boards; and even then there was not always
sufficient straw available to meet requirements. Altogether,
it is declared, the wounded suffered "unheard-of tortures."</p>

<p>Shortly after the conclusion of the war there was appointed
in <i>Prussia</i> a further Commission of medical and military
authorities to renew the investigation into the care and
transport of sick and wounded. The Commission sat from
March 18 to May 5, 1867. In the result it still favoured
the use of sacks of straw, with canvas loops, as the simplest
and most comfortable method to adopt for the rail transport
of recumbent sufferers, though it recommended that the
sacks should be made with side pieces, giving them the
form of paillasses, as this would afford a greater degree of
support to those lying on them. The American system of suspending
stretchers in tiers by means of india-rubber rings
depending from pegs let into wooden uprights was disapproved
of, partly because of the continuous swinging of the
stretchers so carried, and partly because of the assumed
discomfort to one set of patients of having others just above
them. The report also recommended the adoption of the
following principles:&mdash;(1) Through communication between
all the carriages employed in one and the same train for the
conveyance of sick and wounded; (2) provision, for the
severely wounded, either of beds with springs or of litters
suspended from the roof or the sides of the carriages; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
(3) extra carriages for the accommodation of doctor, nurses,
surgical appliances, medical stores, cooking utensils, etc.</p>

<p>These principles were subjected to various tests, and it
was found that in Germany the existing carriages which
could best be adapted to the desired purpose were those
belonging to the fourth-class, inasmuch as they had no internal
divisions or fittings, travellers by them being expected
either to stand during the journey or to sit on their luggage.
The only structural alteration necessary was the placing of
the doors at the end of the carriages instead of at the sides,
so that, on opening these end doors, and letting down a
small bridge to be provided for the purpose, access could
readily be obtained from one carriage to another. Instructions
were accordingly given that all fourth-class carriages
on the Prussian railways should thenceforward have end
doors&mdash;an arrangement which had, in fact, already been
adopted in South Germany. Steps were also taken in
Prussia to adapt goods vans and horse boxes for the conveyance
of sick and wounded in the event of the number of
fourth-class carriages not being sufficient to meet requirements.</p>

<p>The widespread interest which was being attracted
throughout Europe to the subject of the care of the sick
and wounded in war led to a series of experimental trials
being carried out at the <i>Paris International Exhibition of
1867</i>, when, with the help of a short line of railway laid
down in the exhibition grounds and of a goods wagon
supplied by the Western of France Railway Company, a
number of different systems were tested. On this occasion,
also, a model of an American car fitted up with india-rubber
rings for the handles of stretchers was shown.</p>

<p>At this time, and for many years afterwards, the ideal
arrangement was considered, on the Continent of Europe,
to be one under which railway vehicles sent to the front
with troops, supplies or munitions could be readily adapted
for bringing back the sick and wounded on the return
journey; and alike in Germany, Russia, France, Austria
and Italy the respective merits of a great variety of internal
fittings designed to adapt existing rolling stock, whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
passenger coaches, luggage vans, Post Office vans or goods
wagons, to the serving of these dual purposes formed the
subject of much experiment and controversy. Rope cables
across the roof of a goods wagon, with dependent loops of
rope for the reception of the stretcher handles (as in the
Zavodovski method); stretchers laid on springs on the
floor, suspended from the roof either by strong springs or
by rope, resting on brackets attached to the sides, or partly
resting and partly suspended; and collapsible frames of
various kinds, each had their respective advocates.<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The
use and equipment of ambulance or hospital trains constituted,
also, a regular subject of discussion at all the
international congresses of Red Cross Societies which have
been held since 1869.</p>

<p>The experimental trials at the Paris Exhibition of 1867
were followed by the appointment in <i>Prussia</i> of still another
Commission of inquiry, and, acting on the recommendations
of this body, the Prussian Government adopted the "Grund"
system, under which the stretchers whereon the recumbent
sufferers lay in the goods wagons or fourth-class carriages
were placed on poles resting in slots over the convexity of
laminated springs having one end screwed into the floor
while the other, and free, end was provided with a roller
designed to respond to the varying conditions of weight by
sliding to and fro. This was the system mainly used in the
"sanitary trains" of the Germans in the <i>Franco-Prussian
War of 1870-71</i>. It was criticised on the ground (1) that
the sick and wounded were still subject to the same jolts
and concussions as ordinary seated passengers; (2) that
the number who could be carried per carriage or wagon was
very small, since it was still the case that only the floor
space was utilised; and (3) that it was inconvenient for
the doctor and the attendants to have to kneel down in
order to attend to the patients.<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Apart from these disadvantages,
the ambulance service of the Germans was well
organised during the war. Of ambulance trains, fitted
up more or less as complete travelling hospitals, twenty-one
were run, and the total number of sufferers removed by rail
is said to have been over 89,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to traffic congestions, the transport to Berlin
of wounded from the army engaged in the investment of
Paris occupied no less a period than six days; but these
journeys were made in the special ambulance trains which,
provided in the later stages of the war, ensured full provision
for the feeding, nursing and general comfort of the sufferers.
The fact that such journeys could be undertaken at all showed
the great advance which had been made since the battle of
Sadowa, when most of the wounded could be conveyed no
further than to cottages and farm-houses in neighbouring
villages.</p>

<p>In the <i>South-African War of 1899-1902</i> the system
favoured was that of having hospital trains either expressly
built for the purpose or adapted from ordinary rolling stock
and devoted exclusively, for the duration of the war, to
the conveyance of the sick and wounded. The "Princess
Christian" hospital train, specially constructed for the
British Central Red Cross Committee by the Birmingham
Railway Carriage and Wagon Company Ltd., according to
the plans of Sir John Furley and Mr. W. J. Fieldhouse, and
sent out to South Africa early in 1900, consisted of seven
carriages, each about 36 ft. in length, and 8 ft. in width,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
for running on the Cape standard gauge of 3ft. 6in. The
carriages were arranged as follows:&mdash;I., divided into three
compartments for (<i>a</i>) linen and other stores, (<i>b</i>) two nurses
and (<i>c</i>) two invalid officers; II., also divided into three
compartments, for (<i>a</i>) two medical officers; (<i>b</i>) dining-room
and (<i>c</i>) dispensary; III., IV., V., and VI., ward-cars
for invalids, carried on beds arranged in three tiers; VII.,
kitchen, pantry, and a compartment for the guard. The
train carried everything that was necessary for patients
and staff even though they might be cut off from other
sources of supply for a period of two or three weeks.</p>

<p>Seven other hospital trains, all adapted from existing
rolling stock in Cape Colony or Natal, were made available
for the transport of sick and wounded in the same war. One
of these, No. 4, was arranged and equipped at the cost of
the British Central Red Cross Committee, under the direction
of Sir John Furley, then acting as the Society's Chief Commissioner
in South Africa. The arrangement of the other
converted trains was carried out by the Army Medical
Service in South Africa, with the co-operation of the Government
Railway officials in Cape Town and Natal. A number
of specially-fitted carriages, placed at convenient distances
on the railways occupied by the British, were made use of
to pick up small parties of sick from the various posts along
the lines, such carriages being attached to passing trains
for the conveyance of the sufferers to the nearest hospital.
Many of them had a regular service up and down a particular
stretch of railway. Some were provided with iron frames
for the support of service stretchers, and others were fitted
up similarly to the ward-carriages of the converted hospital
trains. Convalescents and "sitting-up" patients for
whom no special accommodation was necessary travelled
in such ordinary trains as might be available.</p>

<p>In effect, there are four classes of trains by which, under
the conditions of to-day, the sick and wounded may be
despatched from the seat of war:&mdash;(1) Permanent hospital
trains, specially constructed for the purpose; (2) temporary
hospital trains, made up either entirely of converted ordinary
vehicles or partly of converted and partly of specially-constructed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
rolling stock, their use for this purpose continuing
for the duration of the war; (3) ambulance trains
improvised at railhead out of rolling stock bringing troops,
supplies and stores to the front, the internal fittings for
"lying-down" cases being of such a kind that they can be
readily fixed or dismantled; and (4) ordinary passenger
carriages for slightly wounded or convalescents.</p>

<p>The advantages conferred on armies from a strategical
point of view, under all these improved conditions, are no
less beyond dispute than the benefits conferred on the
individual soldiers, and if railways had done no more in
regard to the conduct of warfare than ensure these dual
results, they would still have rendered a service of incalculable
value. While, also, their provision of an efficient
ambulance transport system, with its speedy removal of
non-effectives, has served the purposes of war, it has, in
addition, by its regard for the sick and wounded themselves,
further served to relieve warfare of some, at least, of its
horrors.</p>

Progress," in <i>The Railway Gazette</i> of December 4, 1914, it is said:
"The comparatively small loss of the Germans by death from
wounds in 1870 was due solely to the fact that they entered upon
the war with what were then considered wonderfully elaborate
arrangements for removing the wounded.... The trains were
composed partly of first-class carriages, for the less badly wounded,
and partly of covered goods wagons.... In these covered vans
were placed beds formed of boards laid on springs. Each van
would hold four or five men, and a sister rode in the van." One
would not, however, consider to-day that there was anything
wonderfully elaborate in an arrangement under which no more than
four or five sufferers were accommodated in each goods van.</p></div></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation in Peace for War</span></h2>


<p>The greater the experience gained of the application of
rail-power in practice, and the closer the study devoted to
its possibilities, in theory, the more obvious it became
that the fullest degree of advantage to be derived therefrom
could only be assured as the result of preparation and organisation
in peace; and this conclusion appeared specially
to apply to countries whose geographical and political
conditions led them to regard it as expedient that they
should always be ready to meet some great national emergency.
The Federal Government of the United States
certainly did succeed, in the early sixties, in creating an
excellent military rail-transport organisation after hostilities
had broken out; but the conditions of warfare to-day
make it essentially necessary that arrangements for the use
of railways for military purposes should, as far as possible,
be planned, perfected or provided for long in advance of
any possible outbreak of hostilities.</p>

<p>Among other considerations which strengthen this view
are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The increasing dependence of armies on rail transport
owing to (<i>a</i>) the vastly greater number of troops employed
now than in former days; (<i>b</i>) the supreme importance of
time as a factor in enabling a Commander-in-Chief to effect,
possibly, an earlier concentration than the enemy, and
so obtain the power of initiative; and (<i>c</i>) the magnitude
of the supplies, munitions and other necessaries wanted
to meet the daily wants of the prodigious forces in the field,
and only to be assured by the employment of rail transport
from a more or less distant base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>II. The complications, confusion and possible chaos
which may result if, without prior preparation, railway
lines designed to serve ordinary transport purposes are
suddenly required to meet military demands taxing their
resources to the utmost extreme.</p>

<p>III. The further troubles that will assuredly arise if, in
the absence of efficient control by properly-constituted and
responsible intermediaries, railwaymen unfamiliar with military
technicalities are left to deal with the possibly conflicting
and impracticable orders of individual military
officers themselves unfamiliar with the technicalities and
limitations of railway working.</p>

<p>IV. The imperative necessity of having an organised and
well-regulated system of forwarding military supplies,
etc., in order both to avoid congestion of stations and lines
and to ensure the punctual arrival of those supplies in the
right quantities, at the right spot, and at the right time.</p>

<p>V. The need, in view of the vital importance of the part
that railways may play in war, of having organised forces
of railway troops and railway workers available, together
with stores of materials and appliances, to carry out, speedily
and thoroughly, all the work that may be necessary for the
repair, construction or destruction of railway lines.</p>

<p>In making the necessary preparations, in time of peace,
to ensure the successful realisation of these and other
purposes, there is a vast amount of work that requires to
be done.</p>

<p>In readiness for the excessive strain that will be thrown
on the railways as soon as they pass from a peace footing
to a war footing, on the order being given for mobilisation,
the military authorities and the railway authorities must
needs have at their command the fullest information as to
the physical conditions, the resources and the transport
capabilities of every line of railway in the country which,
directly or indirectly, may be able to render useful service.
Details as to double or single track; gradients; number
of locomotives, carriages, wagons, horse-boxes and other
vehicles available; and facilities afforded by stations in
important centres as regards number and length of platforms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and sidings, water supply, loading, unloading or
storage accommodation, etc., are all carefully compiled and
kept up to date. As regards rolling stock, lines not likely
to be called upon to carry any military transports at all
may still be able to contribute to the supply of carriages
and wagons wanted to meet the heavy demands on other
railways. By including all lines of railway in the collected
data, it will be known exactly where additional rolling stock
may be obtained if wanted. The carrying capacity of the
different types of carriages, trucks, etc., is also noted. If
necessary, arrangements will be made for the reduction of
gradients, the improvement of curves, the construction of
connecting links between different main lines, the lengthening
of station platforms, or the provision of increased loading
or unloading facilities.</p>

<p>On the basis of the information collected elaborate calculations
are made in regard to such matters as (1) the
number of vehicles required for a given number of men,
with horses, guns, munitions, stores, road vehicles, etc., so
that rolling stock can be used to the best advantage and
according as to whether the troops carried belong to the
Infantry, Cavalry or the Artillery; (2) the number of vehicles
that can be made up into a train going by any one
route; (3) the length of time likely to be taken for the entraining
and detraining respectively of a given unit; (4)
the time intervals at which a succession of troop trains can
follow one another on the same line; (5) the speed of troop
trains; and (6) the further intervals to be allowed in the
arrival at one and the same station, or centre, of a number
of trains starting from different points, so as to avoid the
risk of congestion and of consequent delays.</p>

<p>Military time-tables, corresponding to those in everyday
use, have next to be prepared, showing exactly what trains
must run from given stations, at fixed hours, by clearly
defined routes, to specified destinations as soon as the occasion
arises. The great aim kept in view in the compilation
of these time-tables is, not alone preparation in advance,
but the most complete utilisation possible of the available
transport facilities of the country as a whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>A selection must also be made in advance of the stations
at which troops on long journeys can obtain food, as well
as of the stations to be used as depôts for stores and supplies,
all the necessary arrangements being provided for.</p>

<p>After the initial great strain on the railway resources
involved in mobilisation and concentration, there will
still be an enormous amount of transport to be done during
the campaign. In the one direction there will be a constant
despatch of reinforcements, provisions, clothing, munitions
and supplies or stores to the front; in the other direction
there will be a steady flow of sick and wounded, of prisoners
of war, and of materiel not wanted at the front, followed
by the final return home of the troops at the end of the
campaign.</p>

<p>At each important point along the lines of communication
where special services in connection with the rail transport,
in either direction, are to be rendered, there must be organisation
of such kind as will ensure that whatever is necessary
shall be done promptly and efficiently under the control
of persons of recognised authority and responsibility, and
without any of the friction that would, inevitably, lead to
delays, traffic blocks and other complications.</p>

<p>Nor can the same system of organisation apply to the
whole line of communication, from the base to the limit
of the rail service at the front. A point will be reached
therein where the control, if not the actual operation, of
the railway lines must needs be transferred from the civil
to the military authorities, rendering necessary a scheme of
supervision and working different from that which can
be followed on the sections not within the actual theatre of
war.</p>

<p>Then, if the army should be compelled to retreat before
the enemy, there should be available a sufficiency of forces
skilled in the art of rapidly and effectively destroying
lines, bridges, viaducts, tunnels, or other railway property,
with a view to retarding the enemy's movements until, it
may be, reinforcements can be brought up in sufficient
number to check his further progress. If, alternatively, the
army should advance into the enemy's country, there must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
again be a provision of Railway Troops fully qualified by
previous training and experience both to repair quickly
the demolitions or the damage which the enemy will have
carried out on his own lines and to construct hastily such
new lines&mdash;light railways or otherwise&mdash;as the circumstances
of the moment require. These things done, and still further
advance being made into the invaded territory, the need
will also arise for a staff capable of operating, under war
conditions, the lines of which possession has been taken, in
order that communications with the advanced front and
the forwarding of reinforcements and supplies can still be
maintained.</p>

<p>All these and many other things, besides, must needs
be thought out and prepared for in time of peace, long in
advance of any probable or even any possible war. They
are, in fact, made the subject of exhaustive and continuous
study alike by military officers specially entrusted with
the task and by railway managers commanding all the
technical knowledge requisite for making arrangements calculated
to ensure the prompt and efficient satisfaction of all
such demands for military rail-transport as may, with whatever
urgency, and under whatever conditions, some day
be put forward.</p>

<p>Still more practical do the preparations in peace for war
become when they include the construction of a network
of strategical railways expressly designed to facilitate the
mobilisation of troops, their speedy concentration on the
frontier, or their movement from one point of attack to
another at the theatre of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="smcap">Organisation in Germany</span></h2>


<p>In no country in the world was the desirability of preparing
in time of peace for military rail-transport in time
of war recognised earlier than in Germany. In none has
the practice of such preparation in peace been followed up
with greater study and persistence.</p>

<p>As shown in Chapter I, the military use of railways led
to the proposal and discussion in Germany of definite
schemes for such use as early as 1833; and it is not too
much to say that, from that date down to the outbreak of
the World-War in 1914, the whole subject had received
there an ever-increasing degree of attention from the military
authorities, and, also, from a large body of writers as
a question of the day in its relation more especially to
German expansion.</p>

<p>One great mistake, however, made alike by historians,
by writers in the Press, and by popular tradition, has been
the attributing to Germany of a far higher degree of credit
in regard to the alleged perfection of her preparations for
the <i>Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71</i> than she was really
entitled to claim. Nor, indeed, has the fact been sufficiently
recognised that the organisation eventually elaborated
by Germany for the efficient conduct of her rail-transport
in war had been evolved from studies, investigations, trials,
experiments and tests (in actual warfare or otherwise)
extending over a period of half a century or more, during
which time, also, there was issued a bewildering mass of
laws, rules and regulations, each more or less modifying those
that had gone before and adding still further to the elaborate,
if not the extremely complicated, machinery laboriously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
built up as the result of the universally recognised
genius of the German people for organisation.</p>

<p>The final great test of all this machinery was to be applied
in 1914. Here, however, it must suffice, for present purposes,
to show how the machinery itself was created and
the form it finally assumed.</p>

<p>Down to 1861 Prussia had done no more, in the way of
organising military transport by rail, than issue a series
of Ordinances dealing with the movement of large bodies
of troops, such Ordinances being akin to those which all
the leading countries of Europe had either compiled or
were engaged in compiling. Directly influenced by the
developments of the Civil War in America, Prussia took
the further step, in 1864, of forming a Railway Section of
her General Staff. This new body was actively employed
in the furtherance of Prussia's interests in the Danish War
of the same year, when confirmatory evidence was given of
the advantages to be derived from the use of rail transport
for military movements, journeys that would have taken
the troops sixteen days by road being done within six days
by rail.</p>

<p>The organisation thus applied on a comparatively small
scale in 1864 was further developed by Prussia in the <i>campaign
of 1866</i>.</p>

<p>On that occasion mobilisation and concentration of the
Prussian troops were both carried out mainly by rail,
under the direction of an Executive Commission consisting
of an officer of the General Staff and a representative of the
Ministry of Commerce. This Executive Commission sat in
Berlin, and was assisted by Line Commissions operating
on the different railways utilised for military purposes.
Movements of troops by rail were certainly effected in
one-third of the time they would have taken by road,
while the Prussians, gaining a great advantage, by the
rapidity of such movements, over Austria, routed her combined
forces within seven days of crossing the frontier, and
dictated terms of peace to her within a month.</p>

<p>Some serious faults were nevertheless developed, even
in the course of this very short campaign, in Prussia's rail-transport<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
arrangements, such being especially the case in
regard to the forwarding of supplies. These were rushed
to the front in excess of immediate requirements, the only
concern of contractors or of officers at the base being to get
them away, while the railway companies&mdash;bound to accept
goods for transport and delivery as ordered&mdash;dispatched
them without regard for any possible deficiency in the unloading
and storage arrangements at the other end. The
supplies, forwarded in bulk, followed as close up behind the
troops as they could be taken; but the provision made for
unloading was inadequate, the railway staffs disclaimed
responsibility for the work, and, before long, stations and
sidings at the front were hopelessly blocked, although elsewhere
the shortage of wagons was so great that everything
was at a standstill. Even when wagons had been unloaded,
they were too often left on the lines, in long trains of empties,
instead of being sent where they were most needed. Each
railway company disposed of its own rolling stock independently
of the other companies, adopting the view that
it had no concern with what was happening elsewhere. In
some instances special trains were dispatched for the conveyance
of a few hundred men or a few hundredweights of
stores. Orders which should have gone direct from one
responsible person to another went through a variety of
channels with the result that serious delays and no less
serious blunders occurred. One East Prussian Battalion,
for instance, was sent off by train in a direction exactly
opposite to that which it should have taken.</p>

<p>All these and other troubles experienced were directly
due to the absence of a central controlling body formed on
such a basis that it could (1) govern the rail-transport
arrangements as a whole; (2) supervise the forwarding of
supplies; (3) provide for a proper distribution, and better
utilisation, of rolling stock; (4) secure the prompt unloading
and return of wagons, and (5) form a direct link between the
military authorities and the railway managements and
staffs.</p>

<p>Immediately on the close of the war a mixed committee
of Staff officers and railway authorities was appointed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
under the supervision of von Moltke, to inquire what steps
should be taken to organise the Prussian military transport
services on such a basis as would avoid a repetition of the
faults already experienced, and give a greater guarantee of
efficiency on the occasion of the next war in which Prussia
might be engaged. The desirability of making such preparations
in time of peace doubtless appeared the greater
in proportion as it became more and more evident that
the trial of strength between Prussia and Austria would
inevitably be followed by one between Prussia and France.</p>

<p>The scheme elaborated by the committee in question
took the form of a <i>Route Service Regulation</i> which was approved
by the King on May 2, 1867, and was, also, adopted
by most of the other German States, but was kept secret
until the time came for applying it in practice, as was done
in the war of 1870-71.</p>

<p>The basis of the scheme was the creation of a system of
<i>Route Inspection</i> ("<span xml:lang="de">Etappen Inspektion</span>") constituting a
department of the General Staff, and designed&mdash;</p>

<p>I. To watch over the replenishing of the operating army
with men, horses, provisions, ammunition, and other
military stores.</p>

<p>II. To see to the removal into the interior of the country
of the sick and wounded, prisoners and trophies of war.</p>

<p>III. With the assistance of the troops appointed for the
purpose and the Railway Field Corps, to maintain the line
of communication, viz., railway, roads, bridges, telegraphs,
and postal arrangements; to undertake the government
of the hostile conquered provinces, and other duties.</p>

<p>The preparation of the necessary plans for the attainment
of these objects was entrusted to a <i>Central Commission</i>
composed, partly of officers connected with the General
Staff and the Ministry of War, and partly of prominent
functionaries on the staffs of the Ministry of Commerce,
Industry and Public Works (then in supreme control over
the railways), and of the Minister of the Interior. Two of
its members&mdash;a Staff Officer and a railway expert from the
Ministry of Commerce&mdash;formed an <i>Executive Commission</i>
and exercised a general supervision over the arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
for military transports; though on the removal of the Great
Head-quarters from Berlin, the Executive Commission was
to be succeeded by an <i>Auxiliary Executive Commission</i>,
which would supervise the railways in the interior to be
made use of for supplying the needs of the army.</p>

<p>In time of war the Central Commission was to be supplemented
by <i>Line Commissions</i> formed by military officers
and railway officers in combination, and operating each in
a leading centre of railway traffic. Their function it would
be&mdash;with the assistance of <i>District Line Commissions</i>&mdash;not
only to communicate to the line or lines of railway in their
district such orders as might be necessary for the transport
of troops, guns, ammunition, horses, and supplies, but, also,
to draw up or make the final arrangements in connection
with the time-tables for the running of military trains;
to fix the direction in which the trains would go; to decide
at what stations the troops should stop for their meals or
for their coffee; and, in fact, to arrange everything connected
with the said transport down to&mdash;as it appeared at
the time&mdash;the smallest details.</p>

<p>In the forwarding of supplies, each Army Corps was to
have its own line of communication, separate and distinct
from that of the other Army Corps, the object aimed at
being that of avoiding the confusion and disorder which
might result from the fact of several Army Corps using the
same railway.</p>

<p>Each of such lines of communication would start from
some large railway station forming a <i>Point of Concentration</i>
("<span xml:lang="de">Etappenanfangsort</span>") for the collection and the dispatch
therefrom of supplies for the Army Corps it would serve,
or for the receipt and further distribution in the interior
of persons or commodities coming back from the seat of war.</p>

<p>Along the line of railway, at distances of about 100 or
125 miles, stations were to be selected which would serve as
halting-places for the feeding of troops, for the watering of
horses, for the reception of sick and wounded unable to continue
their journey, for the repair of rolling stock, or for
other such purposes. The furthest point to be reached by
rail from day to day would constitute <i>Railhead</i> ("<span xml:lang="de">Etappenhauptort</span>"),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
whence communication with the fighting line
would be carried on by road, being further facilitated by
<i>Halting Places</i> ("<span xml:lang="de">Etappenörter</span>") <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>The whole of this elaborate organisation&mdash;and here we
come to the weakest point in the system&mdash;was to be under
the supreme direction and control of an <i>Inspector-General
of Communications</i>&mdash;a sort of Universal Provider of every
requirement the Army could possibly need, and responsible
for the fulfilment of a long and exceedingly varied list of
obligations among which the conduct of military rail-transport
became simply one of many items. The special merit
of his position was assumed to be that of a superior authority
who, having the rank of Commandant of a Division, and
being in constant touch both with the Commander-in-Chief
of the Army and with the War Minister, would be
able to establish harmony in the operations of the different
services and corps. The principle itself was sound; but,
in practice, such a multiplicity of duties fell upon him, or,
through him, on his department, that the break-down which
actually occurred in the campaign of 1870-71 should have
been foreseen in advance.</p>

<p>On the declaration of war the Inspector-General was to
organise the stations for the feeding of the troops and horses
proceeding to the front, and was then himself to go to some
station one or two marches from the fighting-line, and fix,
each day, the Railhead Station for the time being, moving
his own head-quarters as occasion might require. From
these head-quarters he was to exercise control and direction
over a staff among whose duties&mdash;apart from those relating
to railways or rail-transport&mdash;were the following:&mdash;A
centralisation of all the services through a Chief of the Staff
giving a common impulse to them according to the instructions
of the Inspector-General; the forwarding of all
troops to the front, special precautions having to be taken
that none were left behind; distribution of the troops on
arrival at their destination; the forwarding of all supplies;
decision of all personal questions that might arise in connection
with the troops; the keeping of journals and
registers, the drawing up of reports, and the carrying on of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
correspondence with the War Minister and the Chiefs of
the army; everything concerned with horses for the
troops, transport and distribution of prisoners of war,
and maintenance of good order among the troops; assurance
of an ample supply of ammunition for the artillery;
construction or provision of barracks, huts, or temporary
hospitals; maintenance of roads and telegraphs; control
of telegraphs and postal services at the seat of war; supervision
of road communications; responsibility for the safe
and regular delivery to the troops of all supplies and necessaries
ordered to meet their requirements, and establishment
of hospitals, infirmaries and convalescent homes, with
the arrangements for the removal thereto of the sick and
wounded.</p>

<p>In regard to railway matters, the Inspector-General was
assisted by a <i>Director of Field Railways</i> who, in turn, had
many duties to perform. Acting in the name and with
the authority of the Inspector-General, he gave directions
to the Line Commissions concerning the succession in which
supplies were to be forwarded, and, in conjunction with the
military and railway authorities, drew up the time-tables
for military transports, submitting them, however, for
the approval of his chief before they were put into operation.
The actual transport of troops and material&mdash;on the basis
of principles the details of which would have been worked
out in advance&mdash;was also to be conducted under the supervision
of the Director of Railways. In the event of any of
the lines being destroyed by the enemy, he was to undertake
their reconstruction, obtaining through the Inspector-General
such helpers&mdash;whether soldiers or civilians&mdash;as he
might require to supplement his own working staff in the
accomplishment of the necessary work. On the lines being
restored, the Director was further to take control of their
operation by means of troops and, also, of railway employés
to be furnished by the Minister of Commerce on the
requisition of the Inspector-General of Communications.</p>

<p>Such was the elaborate machinery which, constructed
alike in peace and in secret by the Great General Staff,
under the direct supervision of von Moltke himself, was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
be tested in the inevitable war with France for which it had
been designed.</p>

<p>According to popular belief, Germany's preparations
for that war were so complete that she had only, as it were,
to press a button, or pull a lever, in order to ensure the
immediate and perfect working of all the plans she had made
in advance. Whether or not this was really so in regard
to her transport arrangements, at least, is a point to which
attention may now be directed.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war a <i>Route Inspection</i>, organised
on the basis already detailed, and having its own Inspector-General
of Communications in charge of, and responsible
for, the efficient working of the entire network of duties
and obligations, was called into being for each of the three
German armies. Subsequently a fourth, under the Crown
Prince of Saxony, was added.</p>

<p>So far as the mobilisation of the German troops and their
concentration on the frontier were concerned the plans worked,
on the whole, remarkably well; though even in this respect
complete success was not attained. There were, in 1870,
nine lines of concentration available, namely, six for the
Northern and three for the Southern Army; and between
July 24 and August 3, there were dispatched by these different
routes 1,200 trains, conveying 350,000 men, 87,000
horses, and 8,400 guns or road vehicles. Yet the delays
which occurred to some of these trains were alone sufficient
to show that the machinery which had been elaborated
was not working with perfect smoothness. On, for example,
the route known as line "C," the troops sent to <span xml:lang="de">Giessen</span>
were&mdash;as told by Balck, in his "<span xml:lang="de">Taktik</span>"&mdash;eleven hours
late in their arrival. They then had their first warm food
after a journey which had lasted twenty-one hours. For
the transport to <span xml:lang="de">Homburg-in-der-Pfalz</span> and <span xml:lang="de">Neunkirchen</span>
forty hours had been allowed. The first train did the
journey in the time, but the next one took ninety hours.</p>

<p>It was, however, in the forwarding of supplies and in the
provisioning of the troops that the greatest difficulties were
experienced; and here there certainly appeared to be little
real advance on the shortcomings of the campaign of 1866,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
notwithstanding all the preparations which had been
made in the meantime.</p>

<p>Comprehensive as it undoubtedly was, the scheme prepared
in time of peace included no adequate organisation
for regulating the transport of supplies to the front and for
ensuring alike their dispatch and their arrival in just such
quantities, and under just such conditions, as would provide
for the needs of the troops from day to day. Magazines
had certainly been set up, but not in sufficient number
or always in the right place. The system, too, of operating
them was defective. Just as in 1866, so in 1870, army
officers, contractors and railway companies, all inspired
by zeal for the welfare of the troops, rushed off train-load
after train-load of supplies to stations provided with an
inadequate supply alike of sidings where the wagons could
be accommodated and of labour for the work of unloading.
Stores were handed to the railway staffs under the same
conditions as in peace time, the idea being, apparently,
that if they were only dispatched as soon as possible they
would be sure to get to the troops in want of them.</p>

<p>As for the conditions at the other end, it not unfrequently
happened that even though the supply-trains might go to
stations where the facilities for unloading them were ample,
the Commissariat or other officers in charge would follow
the example already being set in France by regarding loaded
railway trucks as convenient movable magazines which
should not be unloaded until their contents were really
wanted. This was done regardless of the fact alike that
the trucks thus kept standing on the lines impeded the
traffic and that they were urgently wanted to meet the
shortage of trucks elsewhere. But for the stringent action
taken to check it, the evil due to this use of railway trucks
for storage purposes would have assumed even graver proportions
than was actually the case. Defective, also, as the
German arrangements in this respect undoubtedly were,
they still did not attain to the same degree of inefficiency
as was the case in France.</p>

<p>All the same, the general result of these various conditions
was that serious difficulties were experienced on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
German no less than on the French railways. No sooner
had the concentration of the Prussian troops been completed
than provisions and stores were sent after them in
such volume that a hopeless block, extending to Cologne in
one direction and Frankfort in the other, was speedily produced
on the lines along the left bank of the Rhine, while
the feeding of the troops was brought to a temporary standstill.
The combined efforts of the Prussian Executive
Commission, of the Minister of Commerce and of the Line
Commissions failed for a time to overcome the conditions
of chaos and confusion thus brought about, and on August
11, 1870, instructions had to be given that thenceforward
supplies were to be forwarded only on the express order
of the Intendant-General or of an Inspector-General of
Communications. Yet on September 5 there were standing,
on five different lines, a total of no fewer than 2,322
loaded wagons, containing 16,830 tons of provisions for the
Second Army, or sufficient to keep it supplied for a period of
twenty-six days. Such blocks on the German lines&mdash;though
not always on so great a scale&mdash;were of frequent
occurrence throughout the war.</p>

<p>Trouble arose, also, in getting provisions from the railway
to the troops by reason either of the inadequate number
of road vehicles or because of the use of these for the conveyance
of ammunition or for other purposes, instead.
Thus the Inspector-General of the First Army started with
2,000 road vehicles; but on October 17 the total number
still at his disposal was only twenty. The position became
still worse as the retreating French destroyed the lines
behind them, increasing the difficulties of the invaders in
maintaining their communications with the Fatherland.</p>

<p>While the food supplies for the German troops were thus
blocking the railway lines&mdash;or, alternatively, were going
bad on account either of the heated conditions of the
closed wagons or of exposure to the weather after unloading&mdash;many
of the German troops were suffering severe
privations from lack of adequate nourishment; and they
would have suffered still more but for the provision-trains
or stores of supplies seized from the French at Metz, Forbach,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Verdun, Dôle, Le Hans, and elsewhere. If, indeed,
the French had only refrained from rushing their own
supplies to the extreme front in excessive quantities, or
if they had destroyed those they could not remove in time,
the invaders would, on various occasions, have found themselves
in a condition bordering on starvation. Even as it
was, they were often reduced to the necessity of dependence
on their "iron" rations.</p>

<p>Difficulty was especially experienced in feeding the army
of occupation during the investment of Paris. The supplies
received by train from Germany were equal to scarcely one
half of the actual requirements; a resort to "requisitions"
on the French territory occupied yielded inadequate results;
and the making of a regular daily money-allowance
to officers and men, so that they could purchase their own
supplies in the open market or otherwise, was, at first, far
from satisfactory. It was, in fact, only owing to the most
strenuous effort on the part of the responsible officers, both
during the investment of Paris and in earlier phases of the
war, that the German troops were often saved from actual
want.<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The main reasons for the defects and shortcomings thus
developed in a scheme on which so much care and preparation
had been bestowed were (1) that, while based on
fundamentally sound principles, the scheme in its actual
application threw too great a strain on the department of
the Inspector-General of Communications, which, as we
have seen, was expected to look after, not only rail transport,
but route marching, telegraphs, postal arrangements,
and a great variety of other things besides; (2) that, owing
to the larger number of Army Corps, it was no longer
possible, as had been done in 1866, to place a separate line
of railway at the disposal of each, so as to allow the said
department to superintend the traffic on the basis of its
own organisation; and (3) the absence of a central administration
specially designed (<i>a</i>) to act as an intermediary
and to ensure co-operation and mutual working between
the various Line Commissions and, also, between the
individuals and administrations, both military and civil,
engaged in the conduct of rail-transport; and (<i>b</i>) to control
the traffic as a whole, avoiding difficulties, blocks and delays
assuring a prompt and efficient distribution of supplies, and
guaranteeing the utilisation of rolling stock to the best
advantage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>With a view to overcoming, as far as possible, the trouble
due to the wide extent and the great variety of duties falling
on the department of the Inspector-General of Communications,
it was arranged, during the latter part of the war,
to relieve that department of all responsibility for the
railway services and to transfer the control and direction
of these to the Executive Commission established at the
Royal Head-quarters. In this way it was hoped to utilise
the rail-transport facilities to greater advantage, to decrease
the risk of collisions and delays, and, through a central
organisation, to distribute the transport demands more
equally among the various railways concerned. By means
of these provisional modifications in the original scheme
a better system of operation was obtained during the remainder
of the war. But the complete reorganisation that
was really necessary was then impracticable, and much
friction in the working of the railway services was still
experienced, partly because this needful reorganisation could
not be carried out, and partly because of the conflicting
orders coming from different authorities, each of whom,
under the conditions then existing, was perfectly within
his right in giving them.<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>The difficulties due to the attempts to rush supplies in
excessive quantities direct to the fighting-line, or as near
thereto as possible, were also met, to a certain extent, during
the course of the war, by the setting up of additional railway
magazines or depôts where the forwarding of necessaries
could be better controlled; but it was not until the end of
1870 that any approach to regularity in supplying the wants
of the German forces was finally secured.</p>

<p>No sooner had the war come to an end than the work of
remedying the defects which had been developed was
taken in hand by the Minister of War and the Great General
Staff. Following the creation, on October 1, 1871, of a
Railway Battalion on a permanent basis came, on July
20, 1872, a new Regulation cancelling the one of May 2,
1867, which had been in operation during the war, and
substituting a new basis of organisation in its place.</p>

<p>While retaining the principle of a Central Commission in
Berlin, the scheme of 1872 relieved the route authorities
of all responsibility for rail transport as well as for railway
restoration and operation at the theatre of war, transferring
to a new military department all the duties falling under
these heads, with the further advantage that such department
would be able to control the railways in time of war
independently of the civil authorities, and without the disadvantages
hitherto resulting from the need to deal, in
regard to railway questions, with nine separate Ministries of
Commerce and about fifty different railway companies.
At the same time the principle of co-ordination was to be
maintained by the appointment of an <i>Inspector-General of
Railways and Lines of Communication</i> who, in each of these
departments, would control a far more efficient organisation
than had previously existed, and, also, as director-in-chief,
would constitute a central authority and an intermediary
between the services concerned and the head of the Great
General Staff, under whose direction he would himself act.</p>

<p>Another important feature of the new Regulation was
that a distinction was now drawn between (1) railways on
or near to the theatre of war which could not be worked by
their ordinary staffs, and must needs pass under military
operation, with a paramount military control; and (2)
"home" or other railways, in the rear of the fighting, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
might carry ordinary traffic&mdash;except so far as the lines were
wanted for military purposes&mdash;and might still be worked
by their own staffs, but in the operation of which there
should be a military element in time of war in order to
facilitate the transport of troops and military necessaries.</p>

<p>Various other Regulations, and notably a series in 1878
and 1888, followed that of 1872, and eventually the whole
scheme of organisation, with its additions and modifications,
seeking to provide for every possible contingency, became
extremely complicated. Of the multifarious instructions,
provisions and orders which had been compiled, some applied
to peace only, some to war only, and some to both peace and
war; some to "home" railways and some to railways at
the seat of war; some to military men and some to railway
men, and so on. As an elaborate piece of machinery the
organisation was more comprehensive and more complete
than ever; but the fear arose that there had again been a
failure to take the human element sufficiently into account.
Of those in the military and the railway service who should
have applied themselves in time of peace to a study of the
elaborate and extremely involved provisions which would
apply in time of war, comparatively few, it was found, were
disposed to devote themselves to so uninviting a task.</p>

<p>So there was issued, on January 18, 1899, still another
new Regulation which repealed some of the earlier ones
and aimed at amplifying, condensing, rearranging and
facilitating reference to the provisions remaining in force,
in order that the whole scheme should be made clearer,
simpler and easier to grasp. These results were fully attained,
and, though still subject to the final test of a great
war, such as that which broke out in 1914, the German
Regulation of 1899 might certainly be considered a masterpiece
of organisation as prepared in time of peace. One
especially useful purpose it served was that of defining clearly
the duties, responsibilities, and spheres of action of all
the authorities, civil or military, concerned in the control
and operation of railways for military purposes.</p>

<p>The various Regulations here in question have been
supplemented from time to time by <i>Field Service Regulations</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the first series of which, issued under date May 23,
1887, was designed to take the place of the Ordinances of
1861 relating to the movement by rail of great bodies of
troops. These Field Service Regulations of 1887 constituted
an epoch in the military history of Germany. They were
regarded at the time as offering a resumé of the most advanced
ideas of Moltke, if not, also, as the crowning glory
of military organisation in the reign of William I; and
they certainly exercised a powerful influence on German
military literature. They were, further, the starting-point
of a prolonged series of similar Regulations, all amending,
modifying, adding to, or abbreviating their predecessors.
These changes led to the issue, on January 1, 1900,
of a new edition, based on the exhaustive studies of a
Commission of fourteen members; and still later revisions
resulted in the publication of a further series on March
22, 1908.<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we get still further evidence of the keenness
with which Germany has followed up, in times of peace, her
preparations for war, while the Field Service Regulations,
no less than the other Regulations already detailed, show
the important place that military rail-transport holds in the
view of those responsible in Germany for the making of these
arrangements. "Railways," it is declared in the Regulations
of 1908, "exercise a decisive influence on the whole
conduct of a war. They are of the greatest importance for
mobilising and concentrating the army, and for maintaining
it in a state of efficiency, and they enable portions of it
to be transported from one place to another during the
operations." What the Field Service Regulations do is to
present in concentrated and compact form the working
details, in respect to field service requirements, of those
other and fuller Regulations which cover the whole ground
of military transport in general.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<p>Taking these various sources of information, the nature
of the organisation that Germany has thus effected as the
result of so many years of study and experience may be
summarised as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In time of peace the authorities entrusted with the task
of ensuring, by their preparations in advance, the success
of the whole system of military rail-transport include (1)
the Minister of War; the Prussian Chief of the General
Staff of the Army; the members of the Railway Section
of the Great General Staff, the Line Commissions and the
Station Commissions; authorities concerned in the forwarding,
transport and receiving of supplies, and representatives
of the Commissariat department; and (2) the
Imperial Chancellor, the Imperial Railway Bureau, the
Imperial Administration of Posts and Telegraphs, and the
various railway administrations.</p>

<p>The <i>Prussian Minister of War</i> is the chief representative
of the interests of the Army in all questions relating to the
military use of the railways.</p>

<p>The <i>Prussian Chief of the General Staff</i> of the Army has
under his orders, in time of peace, the military authorities
concerned in rail-transport, and gives them the necessary
instructions. He keeps in close relations with the Imperial
Railway Bureau, and serves as intermediary between that
Bureau and the Prussian Minister of War. It is he who
gives the directions according to which the use of the
railways in war-time is regulated, and he prescribes all the
preparations that are to be made in advance for the facilitating
of such use. On mobilisation, he discharges all the
duties appertaining to the office of the Inspector-General
of Railways and Lines of Communication until that officer
has himself taken them in hand. From that time he issues
instructions according to circumstances.</p>

<p>The <i>Railway Section of the Great General Staff</i> is required,
among other duties, to collect, and have always available,
the fullest and most complete information as to the powers
and facilities of the railways for the transport of troops, etc.
To this end it keeps in constant communication with the
railway administrations, and, also, with the Imperial Railway
Bureau (which centralises all questions affecting railway
administration), completing, if necessary, through investigations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
made by its own officers, the information furnished
annually by the Bureau. The Railway Section further
takes charge of a wide range of details and preparations
concerning military rail-transport in war-time.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of hostilities there is appointed for each
theatre of war an <i>Inspector-General of Railways and Lines
of Communication</i> who, receiving his orders from the Chief
of the General Staff, co-ordinates the two groups of services,
and ensures harmony in their joint working. For
the operation of the railways, as applied to military purposes,
there is a <i>Director of Field Railways</i> who, acting under
the Inspector-General, controls the whole railway service.
Through the Line Commissions or Commandants subordinate
to him he conveys to the railway authorities the necessary
demands or instructions in respect to military transport,
and, in concert with his superior officers, he fixes the boundary
between the lines to be operated on a peace footing and
those that are to be subject to military working. In the
discharge of these and other duties he is assisted by a staff
composed partly of military men and partly of railwaymen.
Each officer concerned in the transport arrangements has a
recognised deputy who can act for him in case of need.</p>

<p>Of <i>Line Commissions</i>, placed in charge, for military purposes,
over the lines of railway in certain districts, and
becoming <i>Line Commandants</i> on the outbreak of war, there
were twenty under the revised Regulation of 1899, the
number being increased in 1904 to twenty-one. The headquarters
of these Commissions are at such centres of traffic as
Berlin, Hanover, Erfurt, Dresden, Cologne, Altona, Breslau,
etc. They serve as intermediaries between the higher
military authorities and the railway administrations with
which they are associated. Each Line Commission consists,
normally, of a staff officer of the active army and a
prominent railway functionary, the former having a non-commissioned
officer, and the latter a railway official, as
secretary, with such further assistance as may be needed.</p>

<p>Subordinate, in turn, to the Line Commissions are the
<i>Station Commissions</i>, which, receiving instructions from
the former, see to the carrying out of the necessary transport<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
requirements either at their particular station or on the
section of line of which they are placed in charge.</p>

<p>While full provision is thus made for the representation
of the military element in the conduct of rail-transport in
time of war, with a view to ensuring its efficiency, precautions
are no less taken to avoid repetitions of earlier troubles
due to questions of responsibility and control, and, more
especially, to the interference of military officers in the technical
operation of the railway lines. On this subject the
Field Service Regulations of 1900 stated (paragraph 496):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Railways can only fully accomplish their important and difficult
task during war if no serious hindrances to their management
are created by the conduct of the troops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the later Regulations of 1908 it was said (paragraph
527):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The important rôle which railways have to fulfil renders it
incumbent on every commander to do all in his power to prevent
any interference with the traffic due to delay, etc., on the
part of the troops. The railway staff and conducting officers
are bound by the transport arrangements made by the railway
authorities.</p>

<p>The conducting officer is responsible for the administration
of the detachment of troops or consignment of stores under
his charge. It is his duty, as regards himself and his charge,
to obey the instructions of the railway officials.</p>

<p>Any interference with the service of the railways is forbidden.</p>

<p>At important stations Railway Staff Officers are appointed
who act as intermediaries between the conducting officers and
the railway officials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Concerning <i>Lines of Communication</i> the Field Service
Regulations of 1908 say:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A railway station, to serve as a Home Base ("<span xml:lang="de">Etappenanfangsort</span>")
will be assigned to every Army Corps. From these
home bases supplies are sent forward to Collecting Depôts
("<span xml:lang="de">Sammelstationen</span>"), which will be established at not too
great a distance from the theatre of war.</p>

<p>In the theatre of war a base will be assigned to each Army,
the situation of which will change according to the progress
of the operations. The Army Corps are connected with the
Field Base by lines of communication roads ("<span xml:lang="de">Etappenstrassen</span>"),
and on these roads posts are formed about 13&frac12; miles
apart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the mass of working details also included in the
various Regulations, these may well appear to provide in
advance for every possible requirement in regard to military
transport by rail, from the movement of entire armies
down to the supply of drinking water at stations and the
taking of carrier pigeons in the troop trains.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="smcap">Railway Troops in Germany</span></h2>


<p>The innovation introduced into modern warfare by the
Federal Government of the United States, in the organisation
on a comprehensive scale of a Construction Corps for
the combined purposes of repairing, destroying and operating
the railways on which so much might depend in the
conduct of war, attracted great attention in Europe, and
more especially so in Germany, which was the first country
on this side of the Atlantic to follow the American precedent,
since adopted more or less completely by all nations
possessed alike of railways and a standing army.</p>

<p>Down to the time of the War of Secession the need for
such a corps had not been realised in Europe; but the
advantages which might be gained therefrom had been
shown in so unmistakable a form that when, in 1866, there
was the certainty of an early conflict between Prussia and
Austria, one of the first steps taken by the former country
was to provide, under a decree of May 6, 1866, for a <i>Field
Railway Section</i>, ("<span xml:lang="de">Feldeisenbahnabteilung</span>,") to be formed,
and designed to operate, on a basis closely approximating
to that which had applied to the corresponding American
corps. The special purposes to be served were defined as
those of rapidly repairing lines of railway destroyed by the
enemy and of destroying railways it might be thought
expedient to prevent the enemy from using. The section
was to be under the orders of the General Staff either of the
Army or of an Army Corps. It was, however, not to come
into being until its services were really required, and it was
then to act for the duration of the war only.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of hostilities three divisions of the corps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
were mobilised, under Cabinet Orders of May 25 and June 1,
one division being allotted to each of the three Prussian
armies operating in different parts of the theatre of war.
The composition of the corps was partly military and partly
civil. The military element was supplied by officers of the
Engineers (one of whom acted as chief), non-commissioned
officers, and a detachment of Pioneers, the last-mentioned
being either carpenters or smiths. The civil element comprised
railway engineers, thoroughly acquainted with the
construction and repair of permanent way, bridges, etc.;
assistant railway engineers, performing the duties of clerks
of the works; head platelayers, foremen, locomotive drivers,
machinists (for the repair of engines, rolling-stock, water
pumps and water tanks), and others. The members of the
civil section were chosen from the staff of the Prussian State
railways by the Minister of Commerce, their services being
placed by him at the disposal of the War Minister. Each
of the three divisions constituted a complete unit.</p>

<p>On the side of the Austrians there was at that time no
similar force available. Three years before there had
been published in Vienna a book, by <span xml:lang="de">Oberst. von Panz</span>,
entitled "<span xml:lang="de">Das Eisenbahnwesen, vom militärischen Standpuncte</span>,"
in which the author expressed the view that details
on the following points, among others, concerning railways
should be collected in time of peace and classified for reference
in case of need:&mdash;Permanent way: system and construction;
gauge and number of lines; whether lines single
or double. Stations: size and construction; which of
them best fitted to serve as depôts. Bridges: underground
works, etc.; which of these could be the most easily destroyed,
or soonest repaired if destroyed, and if prepared
beforehand for destruction. Embankments: size; how
made; slope; if provided with culverts and size of these.
Cuttings: length and depth; slopes; nature of ground;
whether much or little water, and whether danger of landslips.
Tunnels: dimensions and construction; if lined or
cut in rock; nature of cuttings at end and whether they
can be blocked. Large bridges and viaducts: system of
construction; span of arches; whether or not the piers are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
mined.<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Where men, tools, stores and materials can be
obtained, and to what extent.</p>

<p>These recommendations attracted much attention at the
time. They were quoted by <span xml:lang="de">H. L. Westphalen</span> in his book
on "<span xml:lang="de">Die Kriegführung unter Benutzung der Eisenbahnen</span>"
(<span xml:lang="de">Leipzig</span>, 1868), of which a French translation was published
under the title of "<span xml:lang="fr">De l'Emploi des Chemins de Fer en
Temps de Guerre</span>" (Paris, 1869); yet when, just before the
outbreak of war with Prussia, the Commander-in-Chief
of the Austrian Northern Army recommended that a Construction
Corps should be formed, the Minister of War replied
that "the repair of railways was work which should be done
by the railway companies concerned."</p>

<p>All the same, the retarding of the Prussian advance by
interrupting the rail communications became an important
phase of Austrian tactics and was followed up with great
activity. Bridges and viaducts were destroyed, rails torn
up, sleepers burned, points and turntables carried away,
tunnels obstructed and water cranes and pumps rendered
useless. At one place (between Libenau and Sichrau),
where the railway passed through a deep cutting, the explosion
of mines along the top of each bank detached great
masses of rock which, falling on the lines, filled up the
cutting to a height of six or eight feet for a distance of about
250 ft., and could not be removed until, by means of blasting,
they had been broken up into pieces sufficiently small
to be carried away in ballast trucks.</p>

<p>The arrangements made by the Prussians were, however,
so complete as to permit, in most instances, of a speedy
restoration. Even in the instance just mentioned, fifty
Pioneers, aided by twenty labourers, had the line clear for
traffic again before midnight of the day the destruction was
caused.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<p>Each division of the Construction Corps had at its disposal
two locomotives and thirty closed wagons or open
trucks, provision thus being made for the transport of,
among other things, six light covered carts (for use on the
roads in the country to be invaded, horses being requisitioned
therein as necessary); tools; supplies of blasting
powder or gun-cotton; and rails, sleepers, bolts, etc., for
250 yards of railway, reserve materials for a further quarter
of a mile of track being left at intermediate depôts, supplemented
by an unlimited supply at the base of operations.
The construction trains also carried timber, ropes, nails,
scaffolding, clamps, etc., for the prompt repair of small
bridges. Materials for larger bridges or viaducts were stored
at convenient centres.</p>

<p>How the reconnaissance of a line which might have been
subjected to the enemy's destructive tactics was carried
out is thus told by Captain C. E. Webber, R.E., in his
"Notes on the Campaign in Bohemia in 1866":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The reconnaissance starts with, and, until interrupted, keeps
up with, the advance guard, the movement being covered by
cavalry scouts on each side of the line.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the train in charge of the department,
with one engine in front and another behind, advances slowly,
preceded at a distance of about 500 paces by a trolley carrying
one of the officers, four men to work it, and a bugler. On
arriving at any obstruction the trolley signals to the train by
bugle and extra caution is used in advancing towards it. If
in presence of the enemy, the scouts give warning to the officer
in the trolley, who returns to the train and the whole retires.
The second engine can be detached from the rear to send messages
or bring up fresh supplies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But for the successes already gained in the same direction
by the Federals in the United States, the speed with which
repairs were carried out by the Prussian Construction Corps&mdash;then
so recently organised&mdash;would have been regarded
as remarkable. In various instances communication was
restored within from one and a half to three days after the
destruction even of important bridges.</p>

<p>As it happened, however, whilst the Austrians had shown
an excess of zeal in some directions by destroying bridges
when the tearing up of the rails would have answered the
same purpose, the hesitation of the responsible Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
officer to fire the mines which had already been laid to the
bridge over the Elbe at Lobkowitz was of great advantage
to the Prussians, leaving them the use of the line from
Turnau to Prague, Pardubitz and Brünn between July 18
and July 27, on which latter date the bridge was at last
destroyed by order of the governor of Theresienstadt. This
particular bridge was one of exceptional strategical importance,
and, according to Captain Webber, the construction
even of a temporary substitute&mdash;had the Austrians blown
up the bridge before the Prussians could cross it&mdash;would
have taken no less than six weeks. The omission, also, of
the Austrians to remove or to destroy the railway rolling
stock they left behind at Prague, on their retirement from
that city, conferred a further benefit on the Prussians.
These examples would seem to show that promptness in
carrying out destruction at a critical moment may be no less
important on the one side than efficient organisation on the
other for accomplishing the work of restoration in the
shortest possible time.</p>

<p>While the Construction Corps had thus fully justified its
existence, the sudden creation of such a corps for the purposes
of a particular war, and for the period of the war only,
was considered inadequate for a country where a large standing
Army had to be maintained in readiness for action at
any moment, in case of need. Hence it was thought desirable
that Prussia should have a Field Railway Section
established on a permanent and well-organised footing.
There was the further reason for adopting this course because
the Pioneers, composed almost exclusively of reservists,
had received no special training in railway work, while the
railway men themselves, accustomed to building lines in a
solid way for public use, were at a disadvantage when called
on to carry out, with great rapidity, and in a rough and
ready manner, work that was wanted only to serve the
temporary purposes of the Army with which they were
associated.</p>

<p>It was found, also, that the corps, comprising so large a
civil element, had escaped the supervision and control of the
Executive Commission at Berlin which had for its function<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the regulation of all matters concerning military rail-transport.
Nor did the Construction <i>and</i> Destruction Corps
constitute, as well, an Operation Corps, providing for the
working of railways at the theatre of war, and especially of
railways taken from the enemy. The Prussians had, indeed,
been able to command the services of Austrian railwaymen
in working the railways seized in that country; but there
was no certainty that the adoption of a like expedient would
be possible in any future war.</p>

<p>By this time the whole subject of the destruction and
restoration of railway lines as an important element in
modern warfare was attracting attention among military
authorities and writers in Germany. A translation of McCallum's
report was published, and the issue was begun of
what was to develop into a long series of technical papers,
pamphlets or books&mdash;such as, for example, Wilhelm Basson's
"<span xml:lang="de">Die Eisenbahnen im Kriege, nach den Erfahrungen
des letzten Feldzuges</span>" (Ratibor, 1867)&mdash;dealing with the
art of rapidly destroying and restoring railways in time of
war and the most effective measures to be adopted in the
attainment of either end.</p>

<p>These various considerations and developments were, no
doubt, the reason for the issuing, on August 10, 1869, of a
Prussian Royal Decree which created a permanent cadre of
<i>Railway Troops</i> to be constituted of Pioneers who were to
undergo regular instruction in everything relating to the
construction, destruction and operation of railways. A new
Battalion of Pioneers was to be raised for the purpose, and
the whole scheme was to be carried into effect in the course
of 1871.</p>

<p>When, in 1870, the war with France broke out, the preparations
for the creation of this permanent corps were still
proceeding; but the Prussians were, nevertheless, able to
enter on the campaign with four sections of Railway Troops,
subsequently increased to six, including one Bavarian
section. Each section comprised Engineers, Pioneers, railwaymen
and auxiliary helpers, all of whom wore a uniform
having the letter "E" ("<span xml:lang="de">Eisenbahntruppen</span>") on the
shoulder, and carried rifles. Prussia, in fact, once more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
started, as in 1866, with such advantage over her enemy as
might result from her control of a Railway Construction
Corps. At the outset France had no similar body, and
though, during the progress of the war, she hurriedly set
about the creation of a Construction Corps of her own, that
corps did not do very much beyond collecting at Metz and
Strasburg a great store of railway materials which was
afterwards to fall into the hands of the Prussians, and assist
them in their own operations.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the advantage thus gained, the practical
benefits secured by the Germans, although important
in their effect on the final issue, were far from being as great
as the Army leaders may have anticipated or desired. The
destruction work carried out by the French on their own
railways, on their retirement, was much more serious than
anything experienced in the Prussian campaign in Austria.
Thus the works for the re-establishment of the Paris-Strasburg
line (of primary importance to the Germans for the
siege of Paris) extended from September 17 to November 22.
The French had blocked the tunnel of Nanteuil by the explosion
therein of six mines which brought down the walls and
filled the western end of the tunnel with about 4,000 square
yards of sand. Attempts to clear away the obstruction were
a failure, owing to the occurrence of fresh slips due to the
wet weather, and eventually the Construction Corps built
a loop line which avoided the tunnel, and so restored communication.
The defence of some of the principal lines by
fortresses also contributed to the difficulties of the invaders;
though, on the other hand, these difficulties would have been
greater still if the French had always adopted the best and
most scientific methods of interrupting rail communications,
as, presumably, they would have done if they had had the
advantage of a well-organised corps prepared in advance
for the work that required to be done.</p>

<p>At Fontenoy-sur-Moselle, between Nancy and Toul, there
was, for example, a bridge of seven arches, effective destruction
of which would have made a very serious check in the
communications along the principal line between Germany
and Paris; but, instead of blowing up the bridge in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
middle, the men entrusted with the work (in January, 1871)
brought down two arches at the side of the bridge, causing
a break which the Germans were able to fill in with stones
and earth, restoring communication in about seventeen days.
Then, although several of the tunnels in the Vosges mountains
were mined, the mines had not been charged, and before
instructions to blow up the tunnels had been received by
those awaiting them, the Germans were on the spot and took
possession.</p>

<p>On the other hand the absence on the side of the French
of an organised corps for destruction as well as construction
did not prevent the carrying out of some very bold and highly
successful work by parties of <i xml:lang="fr">franc tireurs</i>, who showed alike
their appreciation of the importance of rail communications
and their skill in impeding them.</p>

<p>One especially striking feat in this direction was accomplished
by a company known as the "<span xml:lang="fr">Franc Tireurs</span> of the
Meuse."</p>

<p>Learning that a Prussian troop train was to pass through
Lanois (on the line between Reims and Mons) on October 26,
1870, they resolved to effect its destruction. How they
operated is told by Lieutenant Fraser, R. E.,<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> who arrived
on the spot shortly afterwards, and heard the story from some
of the men engaged on the work.</p>

<p>Any obstruction placed on the line would have been seen.
Hence a different course had to be adopted. Selecting a
spot where the line ran along a 12-ft. high embankment,
to which a well-wooded slope came down on one side, the
<i xml:lang="fr">franc tireurs</i> took up a pair of rails, removed the sleepers,
cut a deep trench across the line, laid some pieces of iron
at the bottom of the trench, placed on the iron a box containing
thirty kilos (2 qrs. 10 lbs.) of powder, and fixed into
the lid of the box a French field shell in such a way that,
when the rail was replaced over the box, the head of the fuse
would be just below the lower flange of the rail. In restoring
the line again in order that there should be nothing to
attract attention, the <i xml:lang="fr">franc tireurs</i> omitted one sleeper so
that the weight of the locomotive should in passing press
the rail down on to the head of the fuse. The party&mdash;some
seventy-five strong&mdash;then withdrew to the shelter of the
woods to await developments.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>In due time the train of forty coaches approached at the
ordinary speed, the driver not suspecting any danger.
When the engine reached the spot where the "torpedo"
had been placed, an explosion occurred which tore up a mass
of earth, rails and sleepers, threw the engine and several
carriages down the embankment, and wrecked the train.
Those of the Prussian troops who got clear from the wreckage
were shot down by the <i xml:lang="fr">franc tireurs</i> under the protection of
their cover. The number of the enemy thus disposed of
was said to be about 400.</p>

<p>Altogether the French, in their efforts to impede the rail
movements of the invader, destroyed many miles of line,
together with no fewer than seventy-eight large bridges and
tunnels, apart from minor interruptions. The repairs and
reconstruction thus rendered necessary threw a great amount
of labour on the Prussian Railway Troops, and much trouble
arose from time to time on account, not only of the inadequate
supply of materials even for temporary constructions,
but, also, by reason of the shortcomings of the workers
themselves. The sections of Railway Troops had been so
recently formed that the men were still without adequate
training. In 1870-71, as in 1866, military members and
civilian members of the Construction Corps were alike
unfamiliar with the special class of work called for in the
repair or the rebuilding of railways under the emergency
conditions of actual warfare. This instruction had, in fact,
to be completed at the theatre of war at a time when the
Corps should have been prepared to show the greatest
efficiency.</p>

<p>Difficulties arose, also, on the side of the Germans in
operating the 2,500 miles of French railway lines of which
they took possession.</p>

<p>There was, in the first place, a deficiency both of locomotives
and of rolling stock. So far as circumstances would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
permit, the French, as they retreated, either took their
railway rolling stock with them or destroyed it, in order that
it should not be used by the enemy. Attempts were made
to meet the difficulty by obtaining constant reinforcements
of engines and wagons from Germany; but even then the
organisation for controlling the use of rolling stock, among
other transport details, was still so defective that commanders
who wanted to ensure the movement of their own
troops by rail did not hesitate to take possession of engines
and carriages set aside for the regular services of the line.
There were, in fact, occasions when, for this reason, the
regular services had to be stopped altogether.</p>

<p>In the next place troubles with the <i>personnel</i> were no less
acute than those with the <i>matériel</i>. In proportion as the
Germans advanced towards Paris the bulk of the French
population retired, while threats and offers of liberal pay
alike failed to secure from those who remained assistance
either in repairing or in operating the lines of which the
invaders had taken possession. In these circumstances not
only engines, carriages and wagons, but no fewer than 3,500
railwaymen&mdash;in addition to the German Railway Troops
already in France&mdash;had to be brought from Germany. Yet
even the resort to this expedient started a fresh lot of
troubles. The railwaymen so imported had been in the
service of different German railway companies whose equipment
and methods of operation varied considerably; so that
when the men were required to work together&mdash;and that,
also, on the lines of a foreign country, with the accompaniment
of much laxity in discipline as well as of much mutual
misunderstanding&mdash;a vast amount of friction arose.</p>

<p>All these experiences emphasised and strengthened the
conclusion arrived at even before the campaign of 1870-71&mdash;that
the real efficiency of Railway Troops can only be obtained
by organising them in time of peace in readiness for
times of war. Such conclusion being now beyond all possible
dispute, action was taken by Prussia with characteristic
promptness.</p>

<p>In accordance with a Royal Order of May 19, 1871, there
was added to the Prussian Army, on October 1 of the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
year, a <i>Railway Battalion</i> ("<span xml:lang="de">Eisenbahnbataillon</span>"), the
special purposes of which were (1) to afford to those constituting
it the means of obtaining, in time of peace, such technical
training as would enable them to construct any railway
works necessary in time of war, to repair promptly any damage
done to railways, and to undertake the entire railway
traffic along lines of communication; (2) to procure, or
prepare, in time of peace, all plant, materials, tools, etc.,
likely to be required in time of war; and (3) to constitute
the nucleus of all necessary railway formations in war.
The Battalion was formed of non-commissioned officers and
men of the now disbanded sections of Railway Troops who
were still liable to military service, supplemented by three-year
volunteers and recruits from all parts of the territory
subject to the Prussian Minister of War, only those being
accepted, however, whose previous occupations fitted them
for one or other of the various grades of railway work. The
officers were obtained mainly, though not exclusively, from
the Engineers. Members of that corps, together with others
who were mechanical engineers by profession, were accepted
as one-year volunteers.</p>

<p>On a peace footing the Battalion was composed of a
Staff and four Companies, each of 100 or 125 men, with a
depôt, and provided with its own means of transport. One
of the Companies consisted exclusively of platelayers and
watchmen. On mobilisation each Company was to be
enlarged into two Construction Companies and one Traffic
Company, giving a total, on a war footing, of eight Construction
and four Traffic Companies. The Corps also had a
reserve division consisting of a Staff, two Companies and a
section of railway employés. All officers having railway
experience who had served in the war of 1870-71 were
included in the reserve.</p>

<p>The training of the Battalion was under the direction of
the Inspector-General of the Engineers Corps. It comprised
(1) theoretical and scientific instruction of the officers
in all branches of railway construction, repair and destruction,
coupled with the study of every branch of railway science
likely to be of advantage in military transport, while special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
importance was attached to a close and constant intercourse
with the staffs of the various railways, and (2) practical
experience of railway construction and operation. This
experience was afforded (<i>a</i>) on the Battalion's practice
grounds, where instruction was more especially given in the
art of rapidly destroying railway track; (<i>b</i>) through the
employment of the men&mdash;subject to the continued maintenance
among them of the principle of a military organisation&mdash;on
many of the private as well as on the State railways
in Germany, such employment including the repair of
bridges, the laying of track, the enlargement of stations,
etc., and (<i>c</i>) by the construction, operation and management
of a short line of railway which, on completion, was devoted
to the public service. The period of training was for either
one or three years and the Battalion was kept up to a normal
standard of about 500 men by a succession of recruits.
These recruits were generally men of a good type, admission
to the Battalion being regarded with the greater favour
inasmuch as the experience gained was found to be of
advantage to the men in obtaining railway employment on
their return to civil life.</p>

<p>In the giving of this practical instruction the purpose
specially kept in view was that of anticipating as far as
possible actual war conditions, and providing for them
accordingly. Thus in the laying of rails for any new line
built by the Railway Troops great importance was attached
to the speed with which the work could be done, the records
of the time taken being very closely watched.</p>

<p>To one group of officers was allocated the duty of studying
all developments in railway science and operation at home
or abroad and conveying information thereon to those under
instruction. A further important feature of the scheme
included the publication of a series of textbooks on railway
subjects regarded from a military standpoint. A beginning
was also made with the collection of large supplies of rails,
bridge materials, etc., for use as required.</p>

<p>In December, 1872, Bavaria created a similar Battalion,
comprising a single Company attached to the 1st Bavarian
Corps. The constitution and the operations of this Battalion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
followed closely the precedents established by Prussia.</p>

<p>Such was the importance attached by the highest military
authorities in Germany to the formation of these Railway
Troops that the Chief of the Great General Staff was their
Inspector-General from the time of the first Prussian
Battalion being created down to the year 1899.</p>

<p>In December 30, 1875, came the conversion of the Railway
Battalion into a <i>Railway Regiment</i>. It was felt that the
cadres of the former did not respond sufficiently to the needs
of the military rail-transport situation, and they were
accordingly enlarged into a Regiment of two Battalions,
with a regimental Staff of forty-eight, and 502 men in each
Battalion. In 1887 the Prussian Regiment was increased
from two Battalions to four, and the Bavarian Battalion
expanded to the extent of two companies in place of one.
In 1890 the Prussian Regiment further became a <i>Brigade</i>
of two Regiments, each of two Battalions, the number of
units thus remaining the same as before; though in 1893
the Prussian Brigade was augmented by two more Battalions,
increasing its force to three Regiments, each of two Battalions
with four Companies in each Battalion, or a total of twenty-four
Companies, of which one was a Würtemberg Company
and two were Saxon Companies, while the Bavarian Battalion
acquired three Companies in the place of two.</p>

<p>In 1899 Prussia took a further new departure by grouping
together, as <i>Communication Troops</i> ("<span xml:lang="de">Verkerstrüppen</span>"),
all the technical units concerned in the railway, the telegraphic
and the air-craft services. This new arm was put
under the control of an officer holding the rank of a General
of Division and receiving his orders direct from the Emperor.
A change was also effected in regard to the Berlin-Juterbog
railway&mdash;a single-track line, 70 km. (44 miles) in length,
which, originally constructed mainly by the Railway Troops,
was operated by them as a means of acquiring experience
in railway working. Prior to the passing of the law of
March 25, 1899, troops for the working staff were supplied
by the Brigade, and the frequent changes were a cause of
some inconvenience. Under the new law a section constituted
of three Prussian Companies and a Saxon detachment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
with a Lieutenant-Colonel as director, was specially created
for the operation of the line.</p>

<p>Altogether the Railway Troops comprised a total of thirty-one
Companies, having 180 officers and 4,500 non-commissioned
officers and men; but these figures were irrespective
of carefully-compiled lists (subjected to frequent revision)
of all reservists possessing railway experience and still liable
for military service. Brigade, Battalions and Companies
thus formed only the cadres of a small army of men considered
qualified to undertake railway work of one kind or
another in time of war.</p>

<p>Even in Germany itself the need for having so large a
body of Railway Troops was called into question some years
ago, on the ground, partly, that it was desirable to keep to
the lowest practicable minimum the number of non-combatants
closely associated with the Army; and, partly, because
of the view&mdash;favoured by Von der Goltz, in his "<span xml:lang="de">Kriegführung</span>"&mdash;that
much of the construction work which the
Railway Troops would carry out might be left to contractors,
without hampering the Army with further bodies of new
troops for special purposes.</p>

<p>To these suggestions it was replied, in effect, (1) that in
any future war the movement of large bodies of troops would
be directly associated with the provision and the maintenance
of adequate railway facilities; (2) that Railway Troops,
constituted in time of peace, would alone be capable of
ensuring the rapid renovation of damaged lines, or the construction
of new ones, in time of war; (3) that works of this
kind, done under great pressure, and serving temporary
purposes only, would differ essentially from railway works
undertaken in peace by ordinary contractors; and (4) that
Germany required a large body of Railway Troops on account
of her geographical position, inasmuch as she might have to
face an enemy on either, or both, of two fronts&mdash;France and
Russia; while if, in the event of a war with Russia, she
should want to send her forces into that country by rail,
she would require to have a large body of Railway Troops
available either for the conversion of the Russian 5 ft. gauge
into the 4 ft. 8&frac12; in. gauge of the German lines (in order that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the engines and rolling stock of the latter could be utilised
on Russian territory), or for the construction of special
military railways as substitutes for the Russian lines.</p>

<p>Whatever the merits of these respective arguments, the
fact remains that the Railway Troops of Germany, created
under the circumstances and conditions here detailed, have
been maintained in steadily increasing numbers, and, also,
in constantly expanding efficiency thanks to what is, in
effect, their School of Railway Instruction and to the great
amount of practical work they have been called upon to do,
whether in the building of strategical lines or in other departments
of railway construction, destruction or working
in which they could gain experience likely to be of advantage
in time of war.</p>

<p>There was, also, according to M. Paul Lanoir, as related
by him in his book on "The German Spy System," a still
further purpose that these Army railwaymen might be called
on to serve. He tells how in 1880, the chief of the system,
the notorious Stieber, conceived the idea of securing the
appointment in every portion of the national railway
system of France (and more especially at important junctions
or strategical centres) of German spies who, competent to
act as railway workers, would, in the event of any future war
between Germany and France, and on receiving the necessary
instructions, destroy or block the railway lines at those
points in such a manner&mdash;as planned, of course, in advance&mdash;that
great delay would occur in the mobilisation of the French
troops owing to the traffic being paralysed for the time
being; the Germans, in the meantime, rushing their own
forces to the frontier. "The extremely important rôle
which would devolve on our railwaymen," adds M. Lanoir,
"at the moment of the declaration of war, in fulfilling their
functions as indispensable auxiliaries to the combatant
army, was already thoroughly appreciated at this period."</p>

<p>Submitted to Prince Bismarck, Stieber's scheme was
approved by him, and, so far as the obtaining of appointments
on the French railways by Stieber's agents was
concerned, the plan had been quietly carried into effect by
the end of 1883; but a casual incident then led to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
discovery of the conspiracy by M. Lanoir himself. Within
a week, as the result of his communications with General
Campenau, Minister of War, the railway companies received
a confidential circular requiring that they should call upon
every foreigner employed by them in any capacity whatever
to become naturalised without delay. Those who would
not adopt this course were to be immediately dismissed.
The number of foreigners then in the employ of the railway
companies was 1,641, and, although 1,459 of them agreed to
become naturalised, there were 182 Germans who refused so
to do. These 182 were at once discharged&mdash;the assumption
being that they were the spies, qualified to act as railway
workers, by whom the dislocation of traffic was to have been
ensured whenever they might receive word to that effect.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="smcap">France and the War of 1870-71</span></h2>


<p>When France went to war with Germany in 1870-71,
her military rail-transport was still governed by regulations
which, adopted as far back as 1851 and 1855, related only
to such matters of detail as the financial arrangements
between the Army and the railway companies, the length
of troop trains, etc., without making any provision for
an organisation controlling the transport of large bodies of
men in time of war. It certainly had been under these
regulations that the French troops were conveyed to Italy
when they took part in the campaign of 1859; but the
defects then developed, coupled with the further lessons
taught by the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, had shown
the need for bringing these early French regulations into
harmony with the conditions and requirements of modern
warfare.</p>

<p>Impressed by these considerations, and realising the
disadvantages and dangers of the position into which his
country had drifted, the French Minister of War, Marshal
Niel, appointed in March, 1869, a "<span xml:lang="fr">Commission Centrale
des Chemins de Fer</span>," composed of representatives of the
Army, the Ministry of Public Works, and the principal
railway companies, for the purpose not only of revising the
existing regulations on military transports but of preparing
a new one to take their place. The Commission held
twenty-nine sittings and it drew up a provisional scheme
on lines closely following those already adopted in Germany
and Austria and based, especially, on the same principle
of a co-ordination of the military with the railway technical
element. This provisional scheme was subjected to various
tests and trials with a view to perfecting it before it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
placed on a permanent basis. But Marshal Niel died; no
new regulation was adopted; the projected scheme was
more or less forgotten; time was against the early completion
of the proposed experiments, while political and military
developments succeeded one another with such rapidity
that, on the outbreak of war in 1870, it was no longer
possible to carry out the proposed plans. So the studies
of the Commission came to naught, and France embarked
on her tremendous conflict with no organisation for military
transport apart from the out-of-date and wholly defective
regulations under which her troops had already suffered in
the Italian war of 1859.</p>

<p>There was an impression that the talent of the French
soldier would enable him to "<span xml:lang="fr">se débrouiller</span>"&mdash;to "pull,"
if not (in the English sense) to "muddle," through. But
the conditions were hopeless, and the results speedily brought
about were little short of chaos.</p>

<p>So far as the actual conveyance of troops was concerned,
the railway companies themselves did marvels. "The
numerical superiority of Germany," as Von der Goltz says
in his "Nation in Arms," "was known in Paris, and it was
thought to neutralise this superiority by boldness and
rapidity. The idea was a good one ... but ... it was
needful that the Germans should be outdone in the rapidity
with which the armies were massed." That the railway
managements and staffs did their best to secure this result
is beyond any possibility of doubt.</p>

<p>On July 15, 1870, the Minister of Public Works directed
the Est, Nord and Paris-Lyon Companies to place all their
means of transport at the disposal of the War Minister,
suspending as far as necessary their ordinary passenger
and goods services; and the Ouest and Orléans Companies
were asked to put their rolling stock at the disposal of the
three other companies. The Est, to which the heaviest
part in the work involved was to fall, had already taken
various measures in anticipation of an outbreak of war;
and such was the energy shown by the companies, as a
whole, that the first troop train was started from Paris at
5.45 p.m. on July 16, within, that is to say, twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hours of the receipt of the notice from the Minister of Public
Works. Between July 16 and July 26 there were despatched
594 troop trains, conveying 186,620 men, 32,410 horses,
3,162 guns and road vehicles, and 995 wagon-loads of
ammunition and supplies. In the nineteen days of the
whole concentration period (July 16-August 4) the companies
carried 300,000 men, 64,700 horses, 6,600 guns and
road vehicles, and 4,400 wagon-loads of ammunition and
supplies.</p>

<p>All this activity on the part of the railway companies was,
however, neutralised more or less by the absence of any
adequate organisation for regulating and otherwise dealing
with the traffic, so far as concerned the military authorities
themselves.</p>

<p>The first regiment to leave Paris, on July 16, arrived at
the station at 2 p.m. for the train due to start at 5.45 p.m.
The men had been accompanied through the streets by
an immense crowd shouting "<span xml:lang="fr">À Berlin!</span>" and, with so
much time to spare, they either blocked up the station or
were taken off by their friends to the neighbouring taverns,
where the consumption of liquor was such that, by the time
the train started, most of the men were excessively drunk.
In addition to this, many had been relieved of their ammunition&mdash;taken
from them, perhaps, as "souvenirs" of an
historic occasion, though destined to reappear and to be put
to bad use in the days of the Commune, later on.</p>

<p>If, however, at the beginning, the troops got to the
station three hours before there was any need, other occasions
were to arise when they kept trains waiting three or
four hours before they themselves were ready to start.</p>

<p>Then, in Germany the concentration of the troops at
some safe point in the interior, and their transport thence
by rail to the frontier in complete units, took place as separate
and distinct operations. In France the two movements
were conducted simultaneously; and this, in itself, was a
prolific source of confusion and disorganisation on the
railways. The troops came to the stations on a peace
footing and in various strengths. One regiment might
have only one-third the strength of another despatched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
earlier the same day or on the previous day, although the
railway company would have provided the same number of
vehicles for both. There was thus a choice of evils as
between removing two-thirds of the carriages (a procedure
which time or the station arrangements did not always
permit); sending the train away only partially loaded; or
filling up the available space either with men belonging to
other corps or with such supplies as might be available at
the moment. Some trains did leave nearly empty, but it
was the last mentioned of the three courses that was generally
adopted. Men of different arms&mdash;Infantry, Cavalry
and Artillery; mobilised troops, reservists, and individuals,
separated, it might be, from their own officers and not
willing to show themselves amenable to the discipline of other
officers&mdash;were thus transported at the same time as, possibly,
a miscellaneous collection of horses, material and commissariat
supplies. Other trains, again, went away so
overcrowded that they could not accommodate all the men
who should have gone by them, many being left behind in
consequence.</p>

<p>Confusion and delays at the railway stations during the
entraining of the troops were rendered the more complete
because the railway staffs failed to get an adequate degree
of support from the military authorities. According to
one of the articles in those regulations of 1855 which were
still in force, "officers were responsible for the prescribed
movements in connection with the entraining, and should
personally co-operate in ensuring observance of the regulations
referring thereto"; but, according to Baron Ernouf,
("<span xml:lang="fr">Histoire des Chemins de Fer Français pendant la Guerre
Franco-Prussienne</span>,") there were officers who refused absolutely
to concern themselves with the entraining of their
men at the Est station in Paris, declaring that this was a
matter to be looked after by the railway officials with
the help of subordinate officers, if they wanted it.</p>

<p>Under such conditions as these, officers in charge of
troops got hopelessly separated from their men, who themselves
might have been sent off with no knowledge of their
proper destination. One General telegraphed to Paris on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
July 21:&mdash;"Have arrived at Belfort. Not found my
Brigade. Not found General of Division. What should I
do? Don't know where my Regiments are." As for the
men, it was not many days before the stations <i>en route</i>
to the front were occupied by a floating mass of "lost"
soldiers, who pretended to be looking for their corps but too
often found it much pleasanter to remain in the station
buffets, and there enjoy the hospitality of local patriots.
Such proportions did this evil assume that in August, 1870,
the railway station at Reims had to be protected against a
mob of from 4,000 to 5,000 "lost" ones, who wanted to
plunder the wagons containing supplies for the front.</p>

<p>Confusion, again, was made still worse confounded by the
multiplicity of orders&mdash;too often contradictory or impossible
to carry out&mdash;which bombarded the railway officials, and
must have driven them at times almost to distraction.
Orders came direct from anybody and everybody possessed
of the slightest degree of military authority. They came
from the Ministry of War, the General Staff, and the Administrative
Staff; from the Quartermaster-General's Department
and the Commissariat; from officers and non-commissioned
officers of Infantry, Artillery and Engineers;
while each individual invariably gave his orders based on the
range of his own particular sphere, or the convenience of his
own particular troops, without any regard for the situation
as a whole, for what might be wanted in other spheres, or
for whether or not it was physically possible for the railway
staffs to do at all what was asked of them, even if they were
not being overwhelmed with those other orders, besides.
Commanding officers of different corps especially distinguished
themselves by presenting to the railway managements
claims for priority in the despatch of Infantry,
Artillery or supplies, as the case might be, threatening them
with grave consequences if, in each instance, they did not
yield such priority at once, though leaving them to meet
an obviously impracticable position as best they could.
Then it might happen that when all the necessary arrangements&mdash;involving
much interference with other traffic&mdash;had
been made, another order would come countermanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the first one, or postponing the execution of it until a later
occasion.</p>

<p>As though, again, the orders from all these independent
military authorities were not sufficient, the railways were
further worried by local authorities who wanted special
trains for some such service as the conveyance of detachments
of garde mobile a distance of ten or twelve miles
to an instruction camp so that the men would not have to
march by road. There were even demands from certain
of the local authorities that they should be allowed to use
railway wagons as barracks for troops.</p>

<p>M. Jacqmin, general manager of the <span xml:lang="fr">Chemin de Fer de
l'Est</span>, relates in his book, "<span xml:lang="fr">Les Chemins de Fer Pendant la
Guerre de 1870-71</span>," that at the moment when the <span xml:lang="fr">Compagnie
de l'Est</span> was providing for the transport of Bourbacki's
forces, and preparing for the revictualling of Paris, the
<span xml:lang="fr">préfet</span> of the Rhone demanded the use of railway wagons
in which to house the <span xml:lang="fr">garde nationale</span> mobilised on the plain
of Vénissieux, on the left bank of the Rhone, there having
been a delay in the delivery of the material for barracks.
The company refused the request, and they had with the
departmental authorities a lively controversy which was
only settled by the decision of the Bordeaux Government
that those authorities were in the wrong.</p>

<p>Typical of the general conditions, as they prevailed not
only in Paris but elsewhere in France, were the circumstances
under which the Nineteenth Army Corps, of 32,000
men, 3,000 horses and 300 guns, was sent from Cherbourg to
Alençon. The troops were late in arriving at the station;
the officers neglected to look after the men; the men
refused to travel in goods trucks; orders and counter-orders
succeeded one another in rapid succession; two or
three hours were required for the despatch of each train,
and delays occurred which must have disorganised the
traffic all along the line.</p>

<p>Great as the confusion undoubtedly was at the points of
despatch, it was far surpassed by that which prevailed at
stations to which trains were sent regardless of any consideration
as to whether or not they could be unloaded there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
with such despatch as to avoid congestion. No transfer
stations&mdash;constituting the points beyond which only the
supplies wanted for immediate or early use at the extreme
front should be taken, the remainder being forwarded as
wanted&mdash;had been arranged, and the consignors, military
or civil, had assumed that all supplies should be sent in
bulk to places as near to the troops as possible. There
were, consequently, many stations close to the frontier
where the rails leading to them were occupied for miles
together by loaded wagons, the number of which was being
constantly added to by fresh arrivals. Many of these
wagons were, in fact, used as magazines or storehouses on
wheels. The same was, also, being done to a certain extent
on the German lines, though with this difference&mdash;that
whereas in Germany there were at the railway stations
route commandants whose duty it was to enforce the
prompt unloading of wagons, in France there was no corresponding
authority. It suited the officers or the military
department concerned to keep the supplies in the wagons
until they were wanted; and this arrangement may have
appeared an especially desirable one from their point of
view because if the army moved forward&mdash;or backward&mdash;the
supplies could be more readily moved with it if they
were still in the wagons.</p>

<p>For these various reasons, there were officers who gave
the most stringent orders that the wagons were not to be
unloaded until their contents were actually required. It
was evidently a matter of no concern to them that the
wagons they were detaining might be wanted elsewhere,
and that, for lack of them, other troops might be experiencing
a shortage in their own supplies.</p>

<p>When the wagons were not deliberately kept loaded, it
might still be impossible for the unloading to be done
because of there being no military in attendance to do the
work. As for the picking out, from among the large number
in waiting, of some one wagon the contents of which were
specially wanted, the trouble involved in this operation
must often have been far greater than if the wagon had
been unloaded and the supplies stored in the first instance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the stations themselves got congested, under like
conditions. The Commissariat wanted to convert them
into depôts, and the Artillery sought to change them into
arsenals. There were stations at which no platform was
any longer available and troops arriving by any further
train had to descend some distance away, several days
elapsing before their train could be moved from the place
where it had pulled up. At stations not thus blocked
trains might be hours late in arriving, or they might bring
a squadron of cavalry when arrangements had been made
for receiving a battalion of infantry.</p>

<p>In one instance a General refused to allow his men to
detrain on arrival at their destination at night, saying
they would be more comfortable in the carriages than in
the snow. This was, indeed, the case; but so long as the
train remained where it was standing no other traffic could
pass. Sometimes it was necessary for troop trains to wait
on the lines for hours because no camp had been assigned
to the men, and there was at least one occasion when a
Colonel had to ask the stationmaster where it was his
troops were to go.</p>

<p>Most of the traffic had been directed to Metz and Strasburg,
and the state of chaos speedily developed at the former
station has become historic.</p>

<p>The station at Metz was a large one; it had eight good
depôts and four miles of sidings, and it was equal to the
unloading of 930 wagons in twenty-four hours under well-organised
conditions. But when the first infantry trains
arrived the men were kept at the station four or five hours
owing to the absence of orders as to their further destination.
The men detrained, and the wagons containing road
vehicles, officers' luggage, etc., were left unloaded and
sent into the sidings. Other trains followed in rapid succession,
bringing troops and supplies, and the block began
to assume serious proportions.</p>

<p>The railway officials appealed to the local Commissariat
force to unload the wagons so that they could be got out
of the way. They were told that this could not be done
because no orders had been received. The Commissariat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
force for the division also declined to unload the wagons,
saying it was uncertain whether the troops for whom the
supplies were intended would remain at Metz or go further
on.</p>

<p>Any unloading at all for several days was next rendered
impossible by the higher military authorities. They asked
the railway officers to prepare for the transport of an army
corps of 30,000 men. This was done, and forty trains
were located at various points along the line. An order
was then given that the trains should be brought to Metz,
to allow of the troops leaving at once. Within four hours
every train was ready, and its locomotive was standing
with the steam up; but no troops appeared. The order
was countermanded. Then it was repeated, and then it
was countermanded over again.</p>

<p>All this time fresh train-loads of supplies and ammunition
had been arriving at Metz, adding to the collection of unloaded
wagons which, having filled up all the sidings began
to overflow and block up, first the lines leading to the locomotive
sheds and next the main lines themselves. Everything
was in inextricable confusion. Nobody knew where
any particular commodity was to be found or, if they did,
how to get the truck containing it from the consolidated
mass of some thousands of vehicles. "In Metz," telegraphed
the Commissary-General to Paris, "there is neither
coffee, nor sugar; no rice, no brandy, no salt, only a little
bacon and biscuit. Send me at least a million rations to
Thionville." Yet it was quite possible that the articles
specified were already in some or other of the trucks on
hand, had the Commissary-General only known where they
were and how to get them.</p>

<p>The railway people did what they could. They unloaded
some of the consignments and removed them a considerable
distance by road&mdash;only to have them sent back again to
Metz station for re-loading and conveyance elsewhere.
Hay unloaded at the station was sent into Metz to some
magazines which, in turn, and at the same time, were
sending hay to the railway for another destination. Finally,
as a last resource, and in order both to reduce the block<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and to get further use out of the wagons, the railway officials
began to unload them and put their contents on the ground
alongside. A big capture alike of wagons and of supplies
was made by the enemy on his occupation of Metz.</p>

<p>Analogous conditions prevailed in many other places. At
Dôle (Dep. Jura) an accumulated stock of loaded wagons
not only filled up all the sidings but blocked up a large
portion of the main line. When the evacuation was decided
on a great waste of time occurred in selecting the
wagons to be moved. Orders given one hour were countermanded
the next; trains which had been made up were
moved forward and backward, instead of being got out of
the way at once; and, eventually, a considerable quantity
of rolling stock, which might and should have been removed,
had to be left behind.</p>

<p>On the Paris-Lyon railway a collection of 7,500 loaded
trucks had accumulated at a time when a great truck
shortage began to be felt, and the whole of these, together
with the provisions and the materials they contained,
fell into the hands of the Germans, whose total haul of
wagons, including those captured at Metz and other places,
numbered no fewer than 16,000. The wagons thus taken
were first used by them for their own military transport
during the remainder of the war; were then utilised for
ordinary traffic on lines in Germany, and were eventually
returned to France. Not only, therefore, had the French
failed to get from these 16,000 railway wagons the benefit
they should have derived from their use but, in blocking
their lines with them under such conditions that it was
impossible to save them from capture, they conferred a
material advantage on the enemy, providing him with
supplies, and increasing his own means both of transport
and of attack on themselves.</p>

<p>The proportions of the German haul of wagons would,
probably, have been larger still had not some of the French
railway companies, on seeing the advance the enemy was
making, assumed the responsibility of stopping traffic on
certain of their lines and sending off their rolling stock to a
place of safety. In taking this action they adopted a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
course based alike on precedent and prudence, and one
fully warranted by the principle of keeping railway rolling
stock designed for purposes of defence from being utilised
by the enemy for his own purposes of attack.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="smcap">Organisation in France</span></h2>


<p>While, on the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian war,
Germany began, as we have seen in Chapter X., to improve
her own system of military rail-transport, with a view to
remedying the faults developed therein, France applied
herself with equal, if not with even greater, determination
and perseverance to the task of creating for herself a system
which, in her case, had been entirely lacking.</p>

<p>Recognising alike her own shortcomings, the imperative
need to prepare for future contingencies, and the still more
important part that railways would inevitably play in the
next great war in which she might be engaged, France
resolved to create, in time of peace, and as an indispensable
factor in her scheme of national defence, a system of military
transport comprehensive in its scope, complete in its working
details, and leaving nothing to chance. Everything
was to be foreseen, provided for, and, as far as circumstances
would permit, tested in advance.</p>

<p>The Prussian organisation of 1870-71 was, admittedly,
and as recommended by Jacqmin, taken as a starting point
for what was to be done. From that time, also, every new
regulation adopted by Prussia in regard to military transport,
and every important alteration made in the Prussian
system, was promptly recorded and commended or criticised
in the ably-conducted French military papers; though in
the actual creation of her own system there was no mere
following by France of Prussian examples. What was considered
worth adopting certainly was adopted; but the
organisation eventually built up, as the result of many
years of pertinacious efforts, was, in reality, based on French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
conditions, French requirements, and the most progressive
ideas of French military science. The French were, also,
to show that, when they applied themselves to the task,
they had a genius for organisation in no way inferior to that
of the Germans themselves.</p>

<p>In his review of the events of 1870-71, Jacqmin declared
that, while the education of France in the use of railways in
time of war had still to be completed, the basis for such
education had already been laid down by Marshal Niel's
"Commission Centrale" of 1869. The two essential conditions
were (1) unification of control in the use of railways
for military purposes, whether for the transport of men or
of supplies; and (2) association of the military element and
the technical element,&mdash;an association which should be
permanent in its nature and apply to every phase of the
railway service, so that before any order was given there
should be a guarantee that it was one possible of achievement,
and this, also, without prejudice to other transport
orders already given or likely to become necessary.</p>

<p>It was these essential conditions that formed the basis
of the organisation which France created.</p>

<p>As early as November, 1872, there was called into existence
a <i xml:lang="fr">Commission Militaire Superieure des Chemins de
Fer</i> consisting of twelve members, who represented the
Ministry of Public Works, the Army, the Navy, and the
great railway companies. Attached to the Ministry of War,
and charged with the task of studying all questions relating
to the use of railways by the Army, the Commission had
for its first duty a revision of the proposals made by Marshal
Niel's Commission of 1869. Following on this came
a succession of laws, decrees and instructions dealing with
various aspects of the situation in regard to military transport
and the military organization of the railways, the
number issued between 1872 and 1883 being no fewer than
seventeen. These, however, represented more or less tentative
or sectional efforts made in combination with the
railway companies, who gave to the Chambers and to the
administrative authorities their most earnest support and
the full benefit of all their technical knowledge and experience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
in regard to the many problems which had to be solved.</p>

<p>In 1884 there were issued two decrees (July 7 and October
29) which codified, modified or further developed the various
legislative or administrative measures already taken, and
laid down both the fundamental principles and the leading
details of a comprehensive scheme which, after additional
modifications or amendments, based on later experiences,
was to develop into the system of organised military rail-transport
as it exists in France to-day.</p>

<p>These later modifications were more especially effected
by three decrees which, based on the law of December 28,
1888, dealt with (1) the composition and powers of the
<span xml:lang="fr">Commission Militaire Superieure des Chemins de Fer</span>; (2)
the creation of Field Railway Sections and Railway Troops;
and (3) the organisation of the military service of railways.</p>

<p>Since its original formation in 1872, the <i>Superior Military
Commission</i> had already undergone reconstruction in 1886,
and still further changes, in addition to those made by the
decree of February 5, 1889, were to follow. In its final
form the Commission still retains the principle of representation
thereon alike of the military and the technical (railway)
element. Presided over by the Chief of the General
Staff&mdash;who, with the help of a special department of that
Staff, exercises the supreme direction of the military transport
services, subject to the authority of the War Minister&mdash;the
Commission is composed of six Generals or other
military officers of high rank, three representatives of the
Ministry of Public Works, and the members of the Line
Commission appointed for each of the great railway systems
and, also, for the <span xml:lang="fr">Chemin de Fer d'État</span>.</p>

<p>All the members of the Commission are nominated by the
Minister of War. The function they discharge is a purely
consultative one. Their business it is to give to the Minister
their views on all such questions as he may submit to
them for consideration in regard to the use of the railways
by the Army, and more especially in regard to&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Preparations for military transports.</p>

<p>2. Examination of all projects for new lines or junctions
and alterations of existing lines, as well as all projects which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
concern railway facilities (stations, platforms, water supply,
locomotive sheds, etc.)</p>

<p>3. The fixing of the conditions to be fulfilled by railway
rolling stock in view of military requirements, and the
alterations which may be necessary to adapt it thereto.</p>

<p>4. Special instructions to be given to troops of all arms
as to their travelling by rail.</p>

<p>5. Agreements to be made between railway companies
and the War Department in respect to transport of troops,
provisions, etc.</p>

<p>6. Organisation, instruction and employment of special
corps of railwaymen (for repairs, etc.).</p>

<p>7. Measures to be taken for ensuring the supervision and
protection of railways and their approaches.</p>

<p>8. The means of destroying and of rapidly repairing lines
of railway.</p>

<p>Heads of the different services at the Ministry of War
can attend meetings of the Commission, in a consultative
capacity, in respect to matters coming within their jurisdiction,
and the Commission can, in turn, apply to the
Minister for the attendance of any person it may desire to
hear.</p>

<p>As far as possible, all plans and arrangements concerning
the transport of troops and supplies in time of war, from the
moment of mobilisation onward, are thus prepared,
examined or provided for in advance. In article 8 of the
Regulation of December 8, 1913, on Military Transports
by Railway ("<span xml:lang="fr">Réglement sur les transports stratégiques
par chemin de fer</span>") it is, in fact, stated that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All the arrangements relating to the organisation and carrying
out of transport for mobilisation, concentration, revictualling
and evacuation are studied and prepared in time of peace.
The Minister gives, to this effect, all the necessary instructions
to the General Staff, to the commanders of Army Corps, and
to the different services. A like course is adopted, in time
of peace, with regard to the study of the conditions under which
the railways will be operated on the lines of communication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The creation, under the law of March 13, 1875, of Field
Railway Sections and Railway Troops was the outcome
of the obvious need of having an organised force able to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
take up the duties of constructing, repairing, destroying
or operating railways at the theatre of war, such force
being established in time of peace and assured all the experience
needed to qualify them for the discharge of those
various duties. France, in fact, was now, in this respect,
to follow the example of Germany, just as Germany had
already been inspired by the example of the United States.</p>

<p>Under a decree of February 5, 1889, <i>Field Railway Sections</i>
("<span xml:lang="fr">Sections de chemins de fer de campagne</span>") were
defined as permanent military corps charged, in time of
war, and concurrently with the Railway Troops, with the
construction, renovation and operation of those railways
of which the working could not be assured by the national
companies. Their personnel was to be recruited from
among the engineers, officials and men employed by the
railway companies and by the State Railways Administration,
such recruiting being carried out either voluntarily
or by reason of liability to render military service; and
they were to form a distinct corps, having its own governing
body with, as its head, a commandant exercising the
functions of a Chef de Corps. In time of peace there were
to be nine sections, each designated by a distinctive number
according to the particular railway system or systems from
which it was formed; though authority was given to the
Minister of War to call further sections into being in case
of war. The number in peace was increased, in 1906, by
the formation of a tenth section from among the staffs of
railways in the "secondary" group, including local lines
and tramways, in order to assure, or to assist in, the operation
of these railways or tramways for military transport
in time of war.</p>

<p>In time of peace the sections were to be subject to inspections,
musters, reviews and assemblies, as ordered by
the Minister of War. A further provision in the decree of
1889 says:&mdash;"All the arrangements relative to the mobilisation
of each section shall be studied and planned in time of
peace. Each section should always be ready, in the most
complete manner, to render its services to the Minister of
War."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Subsequent decrees or instructions constituted each of
the sections a complete unit on the following basis: (1)
A central body; (2) three distinct divisions, namely, (<i>a</i>)
"movement," (<i>b</i>) "voie," and (<i>c</i>) "traction"; (3) a central
depôt common to the three divisions and the central body;
and (4) complementary territorial subdivisions in the same
three classes, and attached to the central depôt of the section.
The territorial subdivisions are designed to provide
a reserve force of men who can complete or strengthen the
existing sections, or, alternatively, be constituted into
additional sections, if so desired by the Minister of War.
The total strength of each section (including 141 allotted
to the central depôt) was fixed as 1,466.</p>

<p>The administration of a section rests with an Administrative
Council formed by the president and the heads of
the several departments, and meeting at least once in every
three months in time of peace, and once a week in time of
war. Authority is exercised over the sections by the Field
Railway Commissions to which they are attached.<a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Men in the active divisions of the sections who are liable
to military service are excused from taking part in the
ordinary military exercises, but may be assembled for
inspections, etc., or to undergo courses of instruction in
railway work. Men in the territorial subdivisions can be
summoned by the Minister of War for "a period of exercises"
in railway work in time of peace; and the fact may
be recalled that advantage of this power was taken during
the French railway troubles of 1910, when the strikers were
required to assume the rôle of soldiers doing railway work
under military authority and control.</p>

<p>The <i>Railway Troops</i> ("<span xml:lang="fr">Troupes de chemin de fer</span>") now
constitute a Railway Regiment ("<span xml:lang="fr">5<sup><i>e</i></sup> régiment du génie</span>")
organised under the decree of July 11, 1899, and comprising
on a peace footing, three Battalions, each of four Companies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>Recruits for the Railway Regiment come from one or
other of the following classes: (1) Young soldiers who were
in the railway service before they joined the Army; (2) an
annual contingent of railway employés selected by the
Minister of War from lists supplied for this purpose by the
administrations of the five great railway companies and of
the State railways, the number so selected not to exceed
240, distributed as follows: <span xml:lang="fr">Compagnie du Nord, 42; Est,
18; P. L. M., 54; Orléans, 42; Midi, 15; État, 69;</span> and
(3) soldiers belonging to Infantry Regiments who, after
one year of training therein, are sent to the Railway Regiment,
those chosen for this purpose being, by preference,
men whose previous occupation in life has adapted them for
railway work.</p>

<p>The railway administrations are also required to provide
from among their officials a certain number of officers and
non-commissioned officers to form a reserve for the Regiment.</p>

<p>A most complete and systematic course of instruction is
arranged.<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It is divided into (1) military instruction and
(2) technical instruction, the purpose of the latter being
defined as that of qualifying the Railway Troops to undertake
at the theatre of war, subject to the authority of the
Director-General of Railways and Communications, works
of repair or destruction of railway lines, or, in case of need,
the provisional working of the railways. In time of peace
it is the duty of the Superior Military Commission for Railways
to advise on all questions concerning the organisation,
instruction and employment of the special troops for railway
work. To enable it to discharge this function the
Commission receives, through the Chief of the General
Staff, all programmes, proposals or reports that may be
issued in regard to the technical instruction of the troops,
giving its views thereon, and making such recommendations
as it may consider desirable.</p>

<p>Such technical instruction comprises (<i>a</i>) that which is
given to the whole of the troops; (<i>b</i>) instruction in particular
branches of railway work given to a limited number of
individuals; (<i>c</i>) instruction to groups of men operating in
companies or otherwise, and (<i>d</i>) instruction obtained on the
ordinary railways. It is further divided into (i) theoretical
and (ii) practical.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>
<p>Among the measures adopted for ensuring the success of
the general scheme, mention might be made of the issuing
of special series of textbooks; the regular working by the
Regiment of about forty miles of railway&mdash;including an
important junction&mdash;between Chartres and Orléans, on the
State Railway system; and arrangements made with the
railway administrations under which (1) a certain number
of Companies belonging to the Regiment are attached to
the ordinary railway systems every year, for periods of two
or three months; and (2) power is given to the railway
administrations to engage the services of the Railway
Troops in carrying out repairs or construction works on
their lines, a mutual advantage thus being obtained.</p>

<p>Finally there is a Railway School ("<span xml:lang="fr">École de chemins de
fer</span>") which has charge of all the materials, tools, etc., used
in the technical instruction of the troops; draws up, under
the orders of the Colonel, programmes of practical work
and instruction; and provides (1) a library which is supplied
with books and periodicals dealing with military,
railway, scientific and historical subjects, together with maps,
plans, decrees, regulations, etc., relating to the military
operation of railways; (2) a collection of tools, instruments
and models; (3) photographic and lithographic departments;
(4) stores of railway construction material for
instruction purposes; (5) other stores of like material for
use in case of war; (6) workshops for practical instruction
in railway repairs, etc.; and (7) practice grounds reserved
exclusively for the Railway Troops.</p>

<p>The fact of these two bodies of Field Railway Sections
and Railway Troops being organised on so practical and
comprehensive a basis secured to France the control of
forces certain to be of the greatest service to her in the next
war in which she might be engaged. It would, also, even
suffice by itself to prove the earnestness, the vigour and
the thoroughness with which, after 1870-71, France entered
upon the improvement of her system of military rail-transport<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
for national defence. There was, however, much
more to be done, besides, before that system could be considered
complete; and here, again, a vast amount of study,
foresight and energy was shown.</p>

<p>Following, indeed, the laws, decrees, regulations, orders,
and instructions issued down to 1889 came so many others&mdash;dealing,
in some instances, with even the minutest detail
concerning some particular phase of the organisation in
course of being perfected&mdash;that a collected series of those
still in force in 1902 formed a volume of over 700 pages.<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Since the issue of this somewhat formidable collection,
still further changes have been introduced, the general
conditions being finally modified by decrees passed on
December 8, 1913.</p>

<p>Without attempting to indicate all the successive stages
in this prolonged series of legislative and administrative
efforts, it may suffice to offer a general sketch of the French
organisation of military rail-transport on the basis of the
laws, regulations and practices in operation on the outbreak
of war in 1914.</p>

<p>Connected with each of the great railway systems there
is a permanent <i>Line Commission</i> ("<span xml:lang="fr">Commission de réseau</span>")
which consists of (1) a technical member who, in practice,
is the general manager of the line; and (2) a military
member, who is a member of the General Staff of the Army.
The former is chosen by the railway administration, subject
to the approval of the War Minister, and the latter by the
War Minister himself. Each Line Commission controls
the services of a combined technical and military staff, and
each Commissioner has a deputy who can take his place
and exercise his powers in case of need. While the Military
Commissioner is specially responsible for measures adopted
from a military point of view, the Railway Commissioner
is specially responsible for putting at the command of the
Army, as far as may be necessary or practicable, all the
resources of the particular railway system he represents.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>The authority of a Line Commission on any one of the
great railway systems extends to the smaller, or secondary,
lines situate within the same territory; but the smaller
companies may themselves claim to be represented on the
Commission by a duly credited agent.</p>

<p>Among the duties to be discharged by a Line Commission
in time of peace are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Investigation of all matters to which military transport
on the line or the system can give rise.</p>

<p>2. Study of all the available resources of the system, in
material and men, from the point of view of military
requirements.</p>

<p>3. Preparation of plans, estimates, and other data in
connection with the movement of troops, etc.</p>

<p>4. Verification of reports concerning extent of lines,
rolling stock, and station or traffic facilities.</p>

<p>5. Special instruction of the railway staff.</p>

<p>6. Inspection of lines, bridges, etc.</p>

<p>7. The carrying out of experiments of all kinds with a
view to ameliorating or accelerating the facilities offered by
the system in respect to military transports.</p>

<p>Should several Line Commissions be interested in some
particular question concerning military movements by rail,
the Chief of the General Staff can summon them to a joint
conference as often as may be necessary. The fact, also,
that the members of the Line Commissions are members
of the Superior Commission assures co-ordination in the
studies carried on as regards the railways in general, and
provides a ready means by which the central body can
obtain the information it desires concerning any one system
or group of systems.</p>

<p>As their district executives, the Line Commissions have
such number of <i>Sub-Line Commissions</i> as may be found
necessary. Each of these is, in turn, composed of a military
member, nominated by the Minister, and a technical member,
chosen by the Line Commission. Then, also, to discharge
the function of local executive, there is at every
important centre of traffic a <i>Station Commission</i> ("<span xml:lang="fr">Commission de gare</span>")<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
which consists of a military officer and the
stationmaster. It receives from the Line or Sub-Line
Commission all orders or instructions concerning military
transport to, from, or passing through, such station, and
is the recognised intermediary for carrying them into effect
and seeing that efficiency is ensured and good order maintained.</p>

<p>A staff, formed of military men and railwaymen acting
in combination, is allotted to each Line, Sub-Line or Station
Commission. Concerning the representation of these two
elements, military and civil, on the one body, article 10
of the decree of December 8, 1913, on Military Transports
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The special function of each of the agents, military or technical,
on the Commissions or Sub-Commissions must, in the
operation of the service, be maintained in the most absolute
manner. At the same time these agents should not lose from
their view the fact that their association is designed to effect
harmony between the exigencies alike of military requirements
and of rail transport, subordinating those of the one to those
of the other, according to circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the time that mobilisation begins&mdash;or even earlier,
on the order of the War Minister&mdash;the members of the
Superior Commission take up their posts <i>en permanence</i>
at the War Office, and those of the Line, Sub-Line and
Station Commissions locate themselves at the stations which
will have been allotted to them in time of peace. Thenceforward
each Station Commission is in constant communication
by telegraph with the Line or Sub-Line Commission
under which it acts, supplementing such communication
by daily written reports. Among the duties to be discharged
by the Station Commissions are those of superintending
the entrainment or detrainment of troops and
the loading or unloading of material; seeing that the
trains required for transport purposes are provided; preventing
congestion of the lines or of the station approaches;
and ensuring the security of the station and of the lines
within a certain radius thereof.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of war the railway companies must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
place at the service of the State either the whole or such of
their lines, rolling stock, and other means of transport as
may be needed for the conveyance of troops, stores, etc.,
to any points served by them. Thenceforward the lines
so required for "strategic transports"&mdash;including therein
mobilisation, concentration, reinforcements, supplies and
evacuations from the theatre of war&mdash;can be used for
ordinary passengers and goods only to such extent as the
Minister may approve.</p>

<p>Following on the order for mobilisation the Minister,
after consultation with the Commander-in-Chief, divides
the railways of the country into two zones&mdash;the "Zone of
the Interior," and the "Zone of the Armies." Of these
the former passes under the supreme control of the War
Minister, and the latter under that of the Commander-in-Chief.
The location of the <i>Stations of Transition</i>, dividing
the one zone from the other, can be varied from time to
time by the Minister, in consultation with the Commander-in-Chief,
according to the developments of the military
situation.</p>

<p>The <i>Zone of the Interior</i> is that part of the railway system
which, though not situated at the theatre of war, is subject
to military control by reason of the services required of it
in the forwarding of troops, supplies, guns, ammunition
and other necessaries. Operation by the ordinary staffs
of the railway systems is continued, but the transports
ordered by the War Minister are regulated by the Chief of
the General Staff. The execution of the orders given is
entrusted from the day of mobilisation to the Line Commissions,
each of which, acting under the authority of the
War Minister, takes charge over the whole of the services
on the lines comprised in its particular territory.</p>

<p>The <i>Zone of the Armies</i> is, in turn, divided into two sections
(1) the "<span xml:lang="fr">Zone de l'avant</span>," in which military operation
of the railways is necessary on account of their nearness
to the fighting-line; and (2) the "<span xml:lang="fr">Zone de l'Arrière</span>," in
which the railways can still be operated by the ordinary
railway staffs, under the direction of Line and Station
Commissions, as in the adjoining Zone of the Interior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Orders given by the Commander-in-Chief in respect to
transport in the Zone of the Armies are carried out under
the supreme control of an officer now known as the <i xml:lang="fr">Directeur
de l'Arrière</i>. The history of this important functionary
affords an excellent example of the way in which the whole
scheme of operations has been evolved.</p>

<p>The "<span xml:lang="fr">Règlement général</span>" of July 1, 1874,&mdash;one of the
earliest attempts to meet the difficulties which had arisen
in 1870-71 in respect to military rail-transport&mdash;was
found to be defective inasmuch as it did not apply, also, to
those road and rear services ("<span xml:lang="fr">Services de l'Arrière</span>") which
are necessarily associated with the rail services and themselves
constitute so important a phase of military transport
as a whole. In 1878 an attempt was made to meet
this defect by the inauguration of a system of "<span xml:lang="fr">Services
des Étapes</span>"; but here, again, the existence of separate
organisations for rail service and road service, without any
connecting and controlling link, was found to be unsatisfactory.
In 1883 a Commission, presided over by General Fay,
was appointed to consider what would be the best course
to adopt, and, in the result, there was issued, on July 7, 1884,
a Decree creating a "<span xml:lang="fr">Directeur Général des Chemins de
Fer et des Étapes</span>," whose duties were more clearly defined
under a Decree of February 21, 1900. In 1908 the title
of this officer was changed to that of "<span xml:lang="fr">Directeur de l'Arrière</span>,"
and, after further revisions, the scope of his authority
and responsibility was eventually fixed by the Regulation
of December 8, 1913.</p>

<p>Taking up his position at the head-quarters of the Commander-in-Chief,
and keeping in close touch, also, with
the Minister of War through the Chief of the General Staff,
the <span xml:lang="fr">Directeur de l'Arrière</span> has for his special function that
of securing complete co-ordination alike between rail services
and road services and between the services in the
Zone of the Interior and those in the Zone of the Armies.
Both from the Minister and from the Commander-in-Chief
he receives information as to operations projected or in
progress, and as to the needs of the armies in <i>personnel</i>
and <i>matériel</i>. His business it is to see that these needs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
according to their order of urgency&mdash;as further communicated
to him&mdash;are supplied under conditions which shall
provide for all contingencies and guard against all possible
confusion or delays. He fixes, among other things, the
lines of communication; he keeps in close touch with the
road services, and&mdash;having, within the limit of his instructions,
complete control over the railways in the Zone of
the Armies&mdash;he decides on the conditions to be adopted
in respect to all transport alike from the interior to the
armies and from the armies to the interior. As between,
also, the Minister of War and the Commander-in-Chief, he
maintains a constant exchange of information concerning
time-tables for military trains and other such matters.</p>

<p>In the discharge of these duties the <span xml:lang="fr">Directeur de l'Arrière</span>
is aided by a staff which comprises both the technical and
the military elements; but he is not himself responsible
for the actual working of either the rail or the road services.</p>

<p>Railway services in the Zone of the Armies are&mdash;subject
to the supreme authority of the <span xml:lang="fr">Directeur de l'Arrière</span>&mdash;under
the control of a <i>Director of Railways</i> who is assisted
by (1) a combined military and technical staff; (2) a Line
Commission for that section of the zone where the railways
can still be worked by their ordinary staffs; and (3) one or
more <i>Field Line Commissions</i> ("<span xml:lang="fr">Commissions de chemins
de fer de campagne</span>"), together with Railway Troops, for
the section where military operation is necessary.</p>

<p>In the interests of that co-ordination to which so much
importance is rightly attached, the Director of Railways
refers to the <span xml:lang="fr">Directeur de l'Arrière</span> all demands for transport
that concern the railways of both the Zone of the Interior
and the Zone of the Armies or involve conveyance by road
as well as by rail. He also passes on to the Commissions
in charge of either section of the railways included in the
Zone of the Armies the orders he himself receives from the
<span xml:lang="fr">Directeur de l'Arrière</span> in respect to such transport requirements
as may concern them. Time-tables drawn up, and
other arrangements made, by these Commissions are subject
to his approval. He further decides as to the distribution,
within the Zone of the Armies, of the rolling stock and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
railway personnel placed at his disposal by the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>The <i>Field Line Commissions</i> are the executive agents of the
Director of Railways in the discharge of the various duties
assigned to him. The number of these Commissions is
decided by the <span xml:lang="fr">Directeur de l'Arrière</span>, and the date of their
entering on their functions is fixed by the Director of Railways.
Each Commission consists of a staff officer and a
railway engineer. Of these the former is military president
of the Commission and has the controlling voice. When he
considers it necessary that he should accept, in addition to
his own responsibility, that of the technical commissioner,
the latter must defer to his views and to the orders he gives.
The president has an assistant&mdash;also a staff officer&mdash;who
can replace him when necessary, while the Commission has
a staff of secretaries and orderlies as approved by the
Minister of War. The personnel of the Commissions includes
Railway Troops ("<span xml:lang="fr">Sapeurs de chemins de fer</span>" and
"<span xml:lang="fr">Sections de chemins de fer de campagne</span>"); a telegraphy
staff; Station Commissions; and "<span xml:lang="fr">gendarmerie</span>" to undertake
police duties in the stations and on the trains.</p>

<p>In addition to making traffic arrangements and undertaking
the operation of those lines at the theatre of war
that may pass under full military control, the Field Line
Commissions are required to carry out such construction,
repair, maintenance or destruction work on the railways as
should be found necessary.</p>

<p>On the <i>Lines of Communication</i> passing through the two
zones and ensuring direct communication between the
interior and such accessible points on the railway as may,
from time to time, be nearest to the armies in the field, the
leading stations <i>en route</i> are required to serve a variety of
military purposes; though in each and every such instance
the system of organisation is such that the duties to be discharged
or the responsibilities to be fulfilled are undertaken
by, or are under the control of, a Commission formed on
the now established basis of representation thereon of both
the military and the technical elements.</p>

<p>For the conveyance of troops, there are, in the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
place, <i>Mobilisation Stations</i> and <i>Junction Stations</i>, whence
the men within a certain district are sent to the <i>Embarkation
Stations</i>, at which complete units for the front are made
up. These are followed by <i>Stations for Meals</i> ("<span xml:lang="fr">Stations
haltes-repas</span>"), for men and horses; though in this case
the "stations" may really be goods or locomotive sheds,
able to accommodate a large number of men. At the end
of the railway line, so far as it is available for troops, come
the <i>Detraining Stations</i>.</p>

<p>In regard to supplies and stores, the first link in the chain
of organisation is constituted by the <i>Base Supply Stations</i>
("<span xml:lang="fr">gares de rassemblement</span>"). Here the supplies going
from a certain district outside the theatre of operations to
any one Army Corps must be delivered; and here they are
checked, made up into full train loads, or otherwise dealt
with in such a way as to simplify and facilitate their further
transport.</p>

<p>In certain cases full train-loads arriving at these assembling
stations pass through to destination, after being
checked; but the general practice is for the consignments
forwarded from base supply stations to go to the <i>Supply
Depôts</i> ("<span xml:lang="fr">Stations-magasins</span>"), serving the purposes of
storehouses from which supplies, whether received from
the base or collected locally, can be despatched in just such
quantities, and at just such intervals, as circumstances may
require. These depôts are organised on a different basis
according to the particular service or purpose for which
they are designed,&mdash;Cavalry, Engineers, Artillery, Medical,
Telegraph Corps; provisions, live stock, clothing, camp
equipment, etc. Their number, character, and location
are decided by the Minister of War in time of peace. On
the outbreak of war those in the Zone of the Armies pass
under the control of the Commander-in-Chief together with
the railway lines within that zone. The situation of the
depôts may be changed, or additional depôts may be opened,
by the <span xml:lang="fr">Directeur de l'Arrière</span>, with the consent of the
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>Each station depôt is under the charge of the military
member of the Station Commission. His special function<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
it is to supply therefrom the wants of the Army in accordance
with the demands he receives. These demands he
distributes among the different departments of the depôt,
giving instructions as to the time by which the railway
wagons must be loaded. He also takes, with the stationmaster,
all the necessary measures for ensuring the making
up, the loading, and the departure of the trains; but he
must not interfere with the internal administration of the
station or with the technical direction and execution of the
railway services.</p>

<p>Provision is also made for the immediate unloading of
trains bringing supplies to the station depôts for storage
there, the military commissioner being expressly instructed
to guard against any block on the lines in or near to the
station. Wagons need not be unloaded if they are to be
sent on after only a brief detention, or if they contain
ammunition forming part of the current needs of the
Army.</p>

<p>From the supply depôts the supplies and stores pass on
to the <i>Regulating Station</i> ("<span xml:lang="fr">gare régulatrice</span>"). This is
located at such point on each line of communication as,
while allowing of a final regulation of supplies going to the
front, does not&mdash;owing to its nearness to the fighting line&mdash;permit
of any guarantee of a fixed train service beyond that
point. The locality of the regulating station is changed
from day to day, or from time to time, according to developments
in the military situation.</p>

<p>The regulating station is in charge of a <i>Regulating Commission</i>
("<span xml:lang="fr">Commission régulatrice</span>"), constituted on the
same basis as a Sub-Line Commission. Receiving orders
or instructions as to the nature and quantities of the supplies
and stores required by the troops at the front, and
drawing these from the supply depôts, the Commission
must always have on hand a sufficiency to meet requirements.
It is, also, left to the Commission to arrange for
the further despatch of the supplies from the regulating
station by means of such trains as, in the circumstances of
the moment, may be found practicable.</p>

<p>As a matter of daily routine, and without further instructions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the supply depôts send one train of provisions each
day to the regulating station, and the latter sends on one
train daily to the front, always, however, keeping a further
day's supply on hand, at or near the regulating station, to
meet further possible requirements. Additional trains,
whether from the supply depôts or from the regulating
station (where rolling stock is kept available) are made up
as needed.</p>

<p>Supplementing these arrangements, the Regulating Commission
may, at the request of the Director of Road Services,
further keep permanently within its zone of action a
certain number of wagons of provisions in readiness to meet
contingencies, the wagons so utilised as <i>Stores on wheels</i>
being known as "<span xml:lang="fr">en-cas mobiles</span>." Should the <span xml:lang="fr">Directeur
de l'Arrière</span> so desire, railway wagons with ammunition can,
in the same way, be kept loaded at any station within the
Zone of the Armies, or, by arrangement with the Minister
of War, in the Zone of the Interior. It is, however, stipulated
that the number of these wagons should be reduced
to a minimum, in order to avoid congestion either of the
stations or of the railway lines.</p>

<p>Beyond the regulating station comes <i>Railhead</i>, which
constitutes the furthest limit of possible rail-transport for
the time being, and the final point of connection between
rail and road services, the latter being left with the responsibility
of continuing the line of communication thence to
the armies on the field of battle.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the Regulating Commission, as soon as
it enters on the discharge of its functions and as often afterwards
as may be necessary, to advise both the General in
command of the Army served by the line of communication
and the Director of Road Services as to the station which
can be used as railhead and the facilities offered there for
the accommodation, unloading, and loading of wagons.
On the basis of the information so given the General-in-Command
decides each day, or as the occasion requires, on
the particular station which shall be regarded as railhead
for the purposes of transport. He advises the Regulating
Commission and the Director of Road Services accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and he further notifies to them his wishes in regard to the
forwarding of supplies to the point thus fixed.</p>

<p>These elaborate arrangements for ensuring a maintenance
of efficiency along the whole line of communication from the
interior to the front equally apply to transport of all kinds
from the theatre of war to the interior. In principle,
evacuations from the army of sick and wounded, prisoners,
surplus stores, and so on, are effected from railhead by
means of the daily supply-trains returning thence to the
regulating station, where the Regulating Commission takes
them in charge, and passes them on by the trains going back
to the Depôt Stations, or beyond. Should special trains
be necessary for the removal of a large number of wounded,
or otherwise, the Director of Road Services communicates
with the Regulating Commission, which either makes up
the desired specials from the rolling stock it has on hand or,
if it cannot do this, itself applies, in turn, to the Director
of Railways.</p>

<p>For dealing with the sick and wounded, every possible
provision is made under the authority of the Minister of
War and the Director-General, the arrangements in advance,
as detailed in the decrees relating to this branch of
the subject, being on the most comprehensive scale. Among
other measures provided for is the setting up of <i>Evacuation
Hospitals</i> ("<span xml:lang="fr">hôpitaux d'évacuation</span>") in the immediate
neighbourhood of the Regulating Stations, if not, also, at
railhead. Elsewhere along the line certain stations become
<i>Infirmary Stations</i>, ("<span xml:lang="fr">infirmaries de gare</span>") where, in
urgent cases, and under conditions laid down by the War
Minister, the sick and wounded <i>en route</i> to the interior can
receive prompt medical attention in case of need. From
the <i>Distribution Stations</i> ("<span xml:lang="fr">gares de répartition</span>"), the sick
and wounded are sent to the hospitals in the interior to
which they may be assigned.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this comprehensive scheme of
organisation aims at preventing the recurrence of any of
those defects or deficiencies which characterised the military
rail-transport movements of France in the war of
1870-71.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The presence, at every important link in the chain of rail
communication, of a Commission designed to secure regularity
and efficiency in the traffic arrangements should
avoid confusion, congestion and delay.</p>

<p>The association, on each of these Commissions, of the
military and technical elements, with a strict definition of
their respective powers, duties and responsibilities, should
ensure the best use of the available transport facilities under
conditions in themselves practicable, and without the risk
either of friction between the representatives of the two
interests or, alternatively, of any interference with the railway
services owing to contradictory or impossible orders
being given by individual officers acting on their own
responsibility.</p>

<p>The setting up of the supply depôts and regulating stations
along the line of communication should prevent (i) the
rushing through of supplies in excessive quantities to the
extreme front; (ii) the congestion of railway lines and
stations; (iii) the undue accumulation of provisions at one
point, with a corresponding deficiency elsewhere, and (iv)
the possibility of large stocks being eventually seized by
the enemy and made use of by him to his own advantage.</p>

<p>The measures adopted both to prevent any excessive
employment of railway wagons as storehouses on wheels
and to secure their prompt unloading should afford a greater
guarantee of the best utilisation of rolling stock under
conditions of, possibly, extreme urgency.</p>

<p>Finally, the unification of control, the co-ordination of
the many different services involved, and the harmony of
working established between all the various sections on the
line of communication linking up the interior of the country
with the troops in the fighting line should assure, not only
the nearest possible approach to complete efficiency in the
transport conditions, but the conferring of great advantages
on the armies concerned, with a proportionate increase
of their strength in the field.</p>

<p>The effect of all these things on the military position of
France must needs be great. Had France controlled a
rail-transport organisation such as this&mdash;instead of none<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
at all&mdash;in 1870-71; and had Germany controlled a system
no better than what we have seen to be the admittedly
imperfect one she put into operation on that occasion, the
results of the Franco-German war and the subsequent
course of events in Europe might alike have been wholly
different.</p>

<p><i>Tests</i> of what were being planned or projected in France
as precautionary measures, for application in war, could
not, of course, be carried out exhaustively in peace; but
many parts of the machinery designed came into daily
use as a matter of ordinary routine. Full advantage was
taken, also, of whatever opportunities did present themselves&mdash;in
the form of exercises in partial mobilisation,
reviews, and other occasions involving the movement by
rail of large bodies of troops&mdash;to effect such trials as were
possible of regulations and instructions already based on
exhaustive studies by the military and railway authorities.
In 1892 the results attained were so satisfactory that a
German authority, Lieutenant Becker, writing in his book
on "<span xml:lang="de">Der nächste Krieg und die deutschen Bahnverwaltungen</span>,"
(Hanover, 1893,) concerning the trials in France,
in that year, of the new conditions introduced by the law of
December 28, 1888, was not only greatly impressed thereby
but even appeared disposed to think that the French were
becoming superior to the Germans in that very organisation
which the latter had regarded as their own particular province.
The following passages from his book may be worth
recalling:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Towards the middle of September, 1892, from a military
railway station improvised for the occasion, there were sent
off in less than eight hours forty-two trains conveying a complete
Army Corps of 25,000 men.</p>

<p>In their famous mobilisation test of 1887 the French despatched
from the Toulouse station 150 military trains without
interrupting the ordinary traffic, and without any accident.</p>

<p>Such figures speak a significant language. They show what
enormous masses of troops the railway can carry in the course
of a few hours to a given point....</p>

<p>If I have referred to the results obtained by our neighbours
on their railway systems, it is not because I have the least fear
as to the final issue of the next war. Quite the contrary; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the fact does not prevent me from asking why the German
Army cannot base on the railways of that country the same
hopes which neighbouring countries are able to entertain in
regard to theirs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The favourable impression thus given, even to a German
critic, by the progress France was making in her creation,
not so much <i>de novo</i> as <i>ab ovo</i>, of a system of organised
military rail-transport, were confirmed by many subsequent
trials, experiments and experiences, all, in turn, leading to
further improvements in matters of detail; but it was, indeed,
the "<span xml:lang="de">nächste Krieg</span>" concerning which Lieutenant
Becker wrote that was to be the real test of the organisation
which, during more than forty years of peace, France
followed up with a zeal, a pertinacity and a thoroughness
fully equal to those of Germany herself.</p>

<p>In any case it would seem that France, though having to
make up for the headway gained by Germany, finally created
a system of military rail-transport which would be able
to stand the fullest comparison with even the now greatly-improved
system of her traditional foe; while the organisation
she thus elaborated, not for the purposes of aggression
but as an arm of her national defence, illustrates in a striking
degree the ever-increasing importance of the problem
of rail-power, and the comprehensive nature of the measures
for its effective exercise which a great Continental nation
regards as indispensable under the conditions of modern
warfare.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Defensive Railways</span></h3>

<p>The measures adopted included, also, the improvement
of the French railway system, since this was no less in need
of amendment and additions in order to adapt it to the
needs of the military situation.</p>

<p>Whilst, as we have seen in Chapter I, the important part
that railways were likely to play in war was recognised in
France as early as 1833, and whilst, in 1842, attention was
called in that country to the "aggressive lines" which
Germany was then already building in the direction of the
French frontiers, the French railway system itself was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
prior to the war of 1870-71, developed on principles which
practically ignored strategical considerations, were based
mainly on economic, political and local interests, and not
only refrained from becoming "aggressive" in turn, but
even failed to provide adequately, as they should have done,
for the legitimate purposes of national defence.</p>

<p>Apart from the absence of any designs on the part of
France against her neighbours' territory, during this period
of her history, one of the main reasons for the conditions
just mentioned is to be found in the predominant position
of Paris as the capital and centre-point of French life and
French movement. Germany at this time consisted of a
collection of States each of which had its own chief city and
built its railways to serve its own particular interests,
without much regard for the interests of its sister States,
even if it escaped the risk of cherishing more or less jealousy
towards them. In France there was but one State and
one capital, and Paris was regarded as the common centre
from which the main lines were to radiate in all directions.
Communication was thus established as between the capital
and the principal inland towns or important points on the
frontiers or on the coasts of France; but the inadequate
number of lateral or transverse lines linking up and connecting
these main lines placed great difficulty in the way
of communication between the provincial centres themselves
otherwise than viâ Paris.</p>

<p>Some of these disadvantages were to have been overcome
under a law passed in 1868 which approved the construction
of seventeen new lines having a total length of 1,840 km.
(1,143 miles). When, however, war broke out in 1870,
comparatively little had been done towards the achievement
of this programme, and France entered upon the
conflict with a railway system which had been even less
developed towards her eastern frontiers than towards the
north, the west and the south, while for the purposes of
concentrating her troops in the first-mentioned direction
she had available only three lines, and of these three one
alone was provided with double-track throughout. Such
were the inadequacies of the system at this time that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
important line between Verdun and Metz had not yet been
completed.</p>

<p>No sooner had the war come to an end than the French
Government started on the improvement of the railway
system in order to adapt it to the possible if not prospective
military requirements of the future, so that they should never
again be taken at a disadvantage; and in carrying on this
work&mdash;in addition to the reorganisation of their military-transport
system in general&mdash;they showed an unexampled
energy and thoroughness. Within five years of the restoration
of peace the French railway system had already undergone
an extension which, according to Captain A. Pernot,
as told in his "<span xml:lang="fr">Aperçu historique sur le service des transports
militaires</span>," would have been possible in but few
countries in so short a period; while of the situation at
the time he wrote (1894) the same authority declared:&mdash;"One
can say that everything is ready in a vast organisation
which only awaits the word of command in order to
prove the strength of its capacity."</p>

<p>Without attempting to give exhaustive details of all
that was done, it may suffice to indicate generally the
principles adopted.</p>

<p>One of the most important of these related to an improvement
of the conditions in and around Paris.</p>

<p>Here the purposes specially aimed at were (1) to establish
further connecting links between the various trunk
lines radiating from the capital, and (2) to obviate the
necessity for traffic from, for example, the south or the
west having to pass through Paris <i>en route</i> to the east or
the north.</p>

<p>These aims it was sought to effect by means of a series
of circular railways, or "rings" of railways, joining up
the existing lines, and allowing of the transfer of military
transport from one to the other without coming into Paris
at all. An "inner" circular railway ("<span xml:lang="fr">Chemin de Fer de
Petite Ceinture</span>") had already been constructed within
the fortifications prior to 1870, and this was followed in
1879 by an "outer" line, ("<span xml:lang="fr">Chemin de Fer de Grande
Ceinture</span>"), which provided a wider circle at an average<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
distance of about 20 km. (12&frac12; miles) and established direct
rail connection, not only between a large number of the
more remote suburbs, together with the different trunk
lines at a greater distance from the city, but, also, between
the various forts constructed for the defence of Paris.</p>

<p>These circular railways were, in turn, succeeded by a
series of connecting links which ensured the provision of a
complete ring of rail communication at a still greater distance
around Paris, the towns comprised therein including
<span xml:lang="fr">Rouen</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Amiens</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">La Fère</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Laon</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Reims</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Chalons-sur-Marne</span>,
<span xml:lang="fr">Troyes</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Sens</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Montargis</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Orléans</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Dreux</span>, and so on back
to <span xml:lang="fr">Rouen</span>. Within, again, this outermost ring there was
provided a further series of lines which, by linking up
<span xml:lang="fr">Orléans</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Malesherbes</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Montereau</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Nogent</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Epernay</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Soissons</span>,
<span xml:lang="fr">Beauvais</span> and <span xml:lang="fr">Dreux</span>, established additional connections
between all the lines from Paris to the north and the
east of France, and gave increased facilities for the distribution
in those directions of troops arriving at <span xml:lang="fr">Orléans</span>
from the south-west, this being once more done without
any need for their entering Paris or even approaching it at
a closer distance than about forty miles.</p>

<p><span xml:lang="fr">Orléans</span> itself was recognised as a point of great strategical
importance in regard to the movement of troops, and it was,
accordingly, provided with a number of new lines radiating
therefrom, and establishing better connections with other
lines. <span xml:lang="fr">Tours</span> and other centres of military significance,
from the same point of view, were strengthened in a like
manner. At important junctions, and notably so in the
case of <span xml:lang="fr">Troyes</span> (<span xml:lang="fr">Champagne</span>), loop lines were built in order
that troop trains could be transferred direct from one line
to another without stopping, and with no need for shunting
or for changing the position of the engine.</p>

<p>In the direction of the eastern frontier the line from <span xml:lang="fr">Verdun</span>
to <span xml:lang="fr">Metz</span> was completed, and by 1899 the three routes
which could alone be made use of in 1870-71 had been increased
to ten. Most of them were provided with double-track
throughout, and all of them were independent of one
another, though having intercommunication by means
of cross lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Other new railways established connection with or between
the forts on both the eastern and the northern frontiers.
Others, again, provided direct communication
between different harbours or between each of them and
strategical points in the interior, thus contributing to the
possibilities of their defence in case of attack from the sea.
Still others were designed for the defence of the French Alps.</p>

<p>Apart from the provision of all these new lines, much
was done in the doubling or even the quadrupling of existing
track wherever the question of military transport came
into consideration at all. Then at railway stations near
to arsenals, and at important strategical centres, specially
long platforms were provided to allow of the rapid entraining
of men or material in case of need.</p>

<p>While, also, so much was being done for the improvement
of the French railway system from an avowedly strategical
point of view, there were many additional lines constructed
or improvements made which, although designed to further
the interests of trade and travel, also added to the sum
total of available facilities for military transport.</p>

<p>The advantages specially aimed at were (1) the ensuring
of a more rapid mobilisation of troops through the betterment
of cross-country connections; (2) the avoidance of
congestion of traffic in Paris; (3) the securing of a more
rapid concentration on the frontiers, especially when each
Army Corps could be assured the independent use of a
double-track line of rails for its own use; and (4) the more
effective defence of all vital points.</p>

<p>National defence, rather than the building of strategical
lines designed to serve "aggressive" purposes, was the
fundamental principle on which the policy thus followed
since 1870-71 was based; and if, as Captain Pernot wrote
in 1894, everything was even then ready for all emergencies,
the continuous additions and improvements made
since that time, bringing the railway system of the country
more and more into harmony with the "<span xml:lang="fr">perfectionnement</span>"
aimed at by France in the organisation of her military
transport, must have made the conditions of preparedness
still more complete by 1914.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="smcap">Organisation in England</span></h2>


<p>The difference between the geographical conditions of
the British Isles and those of the principal countries on the
Continent of Europe led to the systematic organisation of
rail transport for military purposes being taken in hand
at a later date in the United Kingdom than was, more
especially, the case in Germany. Here there was no question
of building lines of invasion or lines to facilitate the
massing of troops on a neighbour's frontiers. The questions
that alone seemed to arise in England were&mdash;(1) the
relations between the State and the companies in regard
to the use of the railways for the transport of troops and
military necessaries under conditions either of peace or of
war; (2) the employment of railways both for resisting
invasion and for the conveyance of expeditionary forces
to the port of embarkation; (3) the adoption of such means
as would ensure the efficient working of the railways under
war conditions; and (4) the creation of an Army engineering
force providing for the construction, repair, operation
or destruction of railways either at home, in case of invasion,
or to facilitate operations in overseas expeditions
through the building and working of military railways.</p>

<p>With these various considerations it may be convenient
to deal in the order as here given.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The State and the Railways</span></h3>

<p>In the Railway Regulation Act, 1842, (5 and 6 Vict., c.
55,) entitled "An Act for the better Regulation of Railways
and for the Conveyance of Troops," it was provided, by
section 20:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whenever it shall be necessary to move any of the officers
or soldiers of her Majesty's forces of the line ... by any railway,
the directors shall permit them, with baggage, stores, arms, ammunition
and other necessaries and things, to be conveyed, at the
usual hours of starting, at such prices or upon such conditions
as may be contracted for between the Secretary at War and such
railway companies on the production of a route or order signed
by the proper authorities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was the first provision made in the United Kingdom
in respect to the conveyance of troops by rail. It was
succeeded in 1844 by another Act (7 and 8 Vict., c. 85,)
by which (sec. 12) railway companies were required to provide
conveyances for the transport of troops at fares not
exceeding a scale given in the Act, and maximum fares
were also prescribed in regard to public baggage, stores,
ammunition, (with certain exceptions, applying to gunpowder
and explosives,) and other military necessaries.
In 1867 these provisions were extended to the Army
Reserve. Further revision of the fares and charges took
place under the Cheap Trains Act, 1883, (46 and 47 Vict.,
c. 34,) entitled "An Act to amend the Law Relating to
Railway Passenger Duty and to amend and consolidate
the law relating to the conveyance of the Queen's forces by
railway."</p>

<p>State control of the railways in case of war was provided
for under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, (34 and
35 Vict., c. 86,) "An Act for the Regulation of the Regular
and Auxiliary Forces of the Crown, and for other purposes
relating thereto." Section 16 laid down that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When her Majesty, by Order in Council, declares that an
emergency has arisen in which it is expedient for the public
service that her Majesty's Government should have control over
the railroads of the United Kingdom, or any of them, the Secretary
of State may, by warrant under his hand, empower any
person or persons named in such warrant to take possession in
the name or on behalf of her Majesty of any railroad in the United
Kingdom, and of the plant belonging thereto, or of any part
thereof, and may take possession of any plant without taking possession
of the railroad itself, and to use the same for her Majesty's
service at such times and in such manner as the Secretary of
State may direct; and the directors, officers and servants of any
such railroad shall obey the directions of the Secretary of State
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>as to the user of such railroad or plant as aforesaid for her
Majesty's service.</p>

<p>Any warrant granted by the said Secretary of State in pursuance
of this section shall remain in force for one week only, but
may be renewed from week to week so long as, in the opinion
of the said Secretary of State, the emergency continues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Provision was also made for the payment of "full compensation"
to the interests concerned.</p>

<p>The powers of control thus acquired by the Government
followed, in effect, closely upon the precedent already
established in the United States, (see p. 16,) even although
they were not defined with the same elaborate detail. On
the other hand greater emphasis is laid in the English Act
on the provision that the Government "may take possession
of any plant without taking possession of the railroad
itself." This gives them the right to take over the locomotives
and rolling stock of any railway in any part of the
United Kingdom, even though the lines in question may
not themselves be wanted for the purposes of military transport.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the National Defence Act, 1888,
(51 and 52 Vict., c. 31,) traffic for naval and military purposes
is to have precedence over other traffic on the railways
of the United Kingdom whenever an Order for the
embodiment of the Militia is in force.</p>

<p>It was by virtue of the above section of the Act of 1871
that the Government took control over the railways of
Great Britain on the outbreak of war in 1914.</p>

<p>As regards the earlier Acts of 1842 and 1844, these were
mainly domestic measures relating to the conveyance of
troops in time of peace rather than war. The beginnings
of organisation of military rail-transport for the purposes
of war followed, rather, on a realisation both of the possibilities
of invasion and of the weakness of the position in
which England at one time stood from the point of view
of national defence.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Invasion Prospects and Home Defence</span></h3>

<p>In 1847 the Duke of Wellington, (then Commander-in-Chief,)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
addressed to Sir John Burgoyne a letter in which
he said he had endeavoured to awaken the attention of
different Administrations to the defenceless state of the
country. We had, he declared, no defence, or hope of
chance of defence, except in our Fleet, and he was especially
sensible both of the certainty of failure if we did not, at an
early moment, attend to the measures necessary to be
taken for our defence and of "the disgrace, the indelible
disgrace," of such failure. Then, in words that greatly
impressed the country, he added:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am bordering upon seventy-seven years of age, passed in
honour; I hope that the Almighty may protect me from being
the witness of the tragedy which I cannot persuade my contemporaries
to take measures to avert.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the result alike of this pathetic warning; of a "Letter
on the Defence of England by Volunteer Corps and Militia"
issued in pamphlet form by Sir Charles Napier in 1852;
and of the Indian Mutiny in 1857, which event called attention
to the defenceless condition of the Empire as a whole,
continuous efforts were made to secure the creation of
Volunteer Corps for the purposes of defence. For a period
of twelve years these efforts met with persistent discouragement,
the Government refusing official recognition to certain
corps of riflemen tentatively formed; but in 1859 the
prospect of an early invasion of this country by France
aroused public feeling to such an extent that on May 12
the then Secretary of State for War, General Peel, addressed
a circular to the Lord-Lieutenants of counties in Great
Britain announcing that Volunteer Corps might be formed
under an Act passed in 1804, when a like course had been
adopted as a precautionary measure against the threatened
invasion of England by Napoleon.</p>

<p>The formation of Volunteer Corps was thereupon taken
up with the greatest zeal, and by the end of 1860 the number
of Volunteers enrolled throughout Great Britain was no
fewer than 120,000. Other results of the national awakening
in 1859 were the public discussion of the questions of
coast defence and armoured trains, (of which mention has
been made in Chapter VII,) and the appropriation, in 1860,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of a loan of seven and a half millions for the improvement
of our coast defences and notably the fortifications of Portsmouth
and Plymouth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Engineer and Railway Staff Corps</span></h3>

<p>Already in December, 1859, the necessity for some definite
engineering instruction for Volunteers was being pointed
out, and in January, 1860, the first corps of Volunteer
Engineers was created, under the title of the 1st Middlesex
Volunteer Engineers. Similar corps were formed in various
parts of the country, and by 1867 the number of Volunteer
Engineers enrolled was 6,580.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1860 a further proposal was made
for the formation of a body which, composed of eminent civil
engineers, the general managers of leading lines of railway,
and the principal railway contractors or other employers
of labour, would undertake a variety of duties considered
no less essential in the interests of national defence.</p>

<p>There was, in the first place, the question of the transport
by rail alike of Volunteers and of the regular forces, either
on the occasion of reviews or for the protection of our coasts
against an invader. While it was evident that the railways
could be efficiently worked only by their own officers, it
was no less obvious that plans for the movement of large
bodies of men, and especially of troops, with horses, guns,
ammunition and stores, should be well considered and
prepared long beforehand, and not left for the occasion
or the emergency when the need for them would arise.</p>

<p>In the next place it was suggested that the engineering
talent of the country should be made available for the
purpose of supplementing the services of the Royal Engineers
in carrying out various defensive works, such as the
destruction of railway lines, bridges and roads, the throwing
up of earthworks, or the flooding of the lowland districts,
with a view to resisting the advance of a possible invader.</p>

<p>Finally the great contractors were to be brought into the
combination so that they could provide the labour necessary
for the execution of these defensive works under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
direction of the civil engineers, who themselves would act
under the direction of the military commanders.</p>

<p>Each of the three groups was to discharge the function
for which it was specially adapted, while the co-ordination
of the three, for the purpose of strengthening the country's
powers of resisting invasion, was expected to add greatly
to the value of the proposed organisation.</p>

<p>The author of this scheme was Mr. Charles Manby, F.R.S.,
(1804-1884,) a distinguished civil engineer who for nearly
half a century was secretary of the Institution of Civil
Engineers and was closely associated with the leading
civil engineers, contractors and railway interests of the
country. He submitted his ideas to several members
of the Council of his Institution, and though, at first, the
scheme was not well received, he was subsequently so far
encouraged that in August, 1860, he laid his plan before
Mr. Sidney Herbert, then Minister at War in Lord Palmerston's
second administration. Mr. Herbert expressed
cordial approval of the project, giving the assurance, on
behalf of the War Office, that an organisation on the basis
suggested could not fail to be of public benefit; but Mr.
Manby still met with difficulties alike from several members
of the Council, who either offered direct opposition to the
scheme or else gave unwilling consent to join, and, also,
from the railway companies, who thought that arrangements
for rail-transport might very well be left to themselves,
and that there was no necessity for the suggested
system so far as they, at least, were concerned.</p>

<p>In these circumstances Mr. Manby made, at first, very
little progress; but he was unremitting in his efforts to
demonstrate alike to civil engineers and to the railway
companies the practical benefits from the point of view of
public interests that would result from the organisation
he advocated, and in 1864 he felt sufficiently encouraged
to lay his views once more before the War Office. Earl
de Grey, then in charge of that Department, thereupon
instructed the Inspector-General of Volunteers, Colonel
McMurdo, (afterwards General Sir W. M. McMurdo, C.B.,)
to inquire into and report to him on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>In the result there was created, in January, 1865, a body
known as the Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps,
constituted, according to its rules, "for the purpose of
directing the application of skilled labour and of railway
transport to the purposes of national defence, and for
preparing, in time of peace, a system on which such duties
should be conducted." The Corps was to consist of officers
only, and its members were to be civil engineers and contractors,
officers of railway and dock companies, and, under
special circumstances, Board of Trade Inspectors of Railways.
Civil engineers of standing and experience who
had directed the construction of the chief railways and
other important works, general managers of railways and
commercial docks, and Board of Trade Inspectors of
Railways, were alone eligible for the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.
Other civil engineers and contractors connected
chiefly with railway works, and, also, railway officers other
than general managers, take the rank of Major. Col.
McMurdo was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Corps
on February 9, 1865.<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> As ultimately constituted, the corps
consisted of an Honorary Colonel (now Maj.-Gen. D. A.
Scott, C.V.O., C.B., D.S.C.), thirty Lieutenant-Colonels
including a Commandant, (now Lieut.-Col. Sir William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Forbes, general manager of the London, Brighton and
South Coast Railway) and twenty Majors.<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Functions and Purposes</span></h3>

<p>That the Corps thus created was the direct outcome,
first, of the Volunteer movement, and, through that movement,
of the state of semi-panic into which the country
had drifted in 1859, as the result both of the anticipations
of invasion and the admitted weakness, at that time, of
our national defences, has thus been clearly established.
Writing in 1869, Major-General McMurdo, who had been
raised to that rank in 1868, said in a pamphlet he issued
under the title of "Rifle Volunteers for Field Service"
that the Corps was "prepared to work, not for Volunteers
alone, but for the entire defensive forces of the country."</p>

<p>In this same publication Major-General McMurdo gave
an account of the functions and purposes the Corps had been
designed to serve. Alluding first to the Volunteer movement,
he showed how the railway carriage must both carry
and shelter the Volunteer when moving from one part of
the country to another; and he proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I will ask you to look attentively for a moment at a Bradshaw's
railway map, and you will see that throughout the network of
rails that overspreads the land none of the meshes, so to speak,
in any vital parts of the country, exceed fifteen miles across, from
rail to rail; but as the eye approaches the Metropolis, or any of
the commercial centres, these meshes are diminished to about
one-half the area of the others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then dealt with the operations which the movement
of troops along these lines of railway would involve, and
continued:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The railway schemes for the accomplishment of such delicate
operations would emanate from the Council of the Engineer and
Railway Staff Corps....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>During peace the railway branch of this body is employed in
working out hypothetical plans of campaign, in the development
of which they manipulate in theory the entire rolling-stock and
railway resources of the country, elaborated by special time-tables
and technical reports.</p>

<p>The share taken by the civil engineers is not confined to
providing merely for the class of railway works contingent on
war, whether of construction, demolition, or of reconstruction, but
in supplying the military engineers with information, advice and
labour. No one, for example, can be more familiar with the
features and character of a district than the engineer who has
constructed a line of railway through it. No one is so well able to
point out the results of <i>letting in</i> that which he had been so often
employed in <i>keeping out</i>, viz., the inundations of the sea. None
better acquainted with the existing distribution of labour
power throughout the country, and of the means by which it could
be concentrated upon given points, for the construction of works
of defence. All these elements, in short, by which the gigantic
resources of our country may be safely wielded for her defence,
are now being silently considered and woven into strategical
schemes of operations by these eminent and patriotic men, the
value of whose voluntary services will not be fully comprehended
or appreciated till the day comes when the discomfiture of the
invader shall be accomplished through their instrumentality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same distinguished authority wrote concerning the
Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps in an article
on "Volunteers" which he contributed to the "Encyclopædia
Britannica" (ninth edition):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The ready labour power of this useful Corps is estimated
at from 12,000 to 20,000 navvies, with tools, barrows and commissariat
complete. It has already performed important
service in tabulating, and printing at great private cost, complete
time-tables and special reports for six general concentrations
against possible invasion. A special return was also prepared
by the Corps (the first of its kind) of the entire rolling stock of all
the railways in Great Britain. This important work&mdash;which is
corrected and republished annually&mdash;shows where the requisite
number of carriages of every description can be obtained for the
composition of troop trains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the official catalogue of books in the War Office Library
there is an item which reads:&mdash;"Time Tables for Special
Troop Trains, etc. Compiled by the Railway Companies.
311 pp. 8vo. London, 1866." This, presumably, refers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to the first of the complete time tables mentioned in the
"Encyclopædia Britannica" article as having been compiled
by the Corps. It is evident, from the date given,
that the Corps must have got quickly to work after its
formation in 1865.</p>

<p>At one time there was an expectation that the Engineer
and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps would develop into a
body exercising still wider and more responsible duties
than those already mentioned. On this point we have the
testimony of the late Sir George Findlay, formerly general
manager of the London and North-Western Railway Company,
and himself a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Corps.</p>

<p>Col. J. S. Rothwell had written some articles<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> in which,
while admitting their practically unlimited resources, he
questioned the ability of the British railways, at a few hours
notice, to transport to any part of our coasts which might
be the scene of a hostile invasion a sufficient body of troops
to dispute the advance of an army upon London, and he
further suggested that the whole question was one which
had not yet received the mature consideration it deserved.
Col. Rothwell said, in the course of what he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Though the actual working of our railways must be left in the
hands of the proper railway officials, it does not follow that the
planning of the arrangements for the military traffic should also
be entrusted to them exclusively. This, however, appears to be
contemplated, as, under existing circumstances, such arrangements
would rest with the members of a body called the "Volunteer
Engineer and Railway Staff Corps."... Though the
efficiency of these gentlemen in their own sphere is undeniable,
it appears open to question whether they are likely to have sufficient
leisure personally to work out the details of a large concentration
of troops by rail, and whether the special requirements
of military transport will be fully appreciated by them, or by the
subordinates whom they presumably will employ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much, he argued, required to be done before the country
could be considered ready to meet a possible invader;
and he concluded:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>If the invasion of England is to be regarded as an event which
is within the bounds of possibility, it is surely not unreasonable
to ask that those precautionary measures which require time for
their elaboration shall be thoroughly worked out before there is
any risk of our wanting to employ them. The organisation for
the conveyance of our troops by railway is such a measure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To these criticisms Sir George Findlay replied in an
article "On the Use of Railways in the United Kingdom
for the Conveyance of Troops," published in the <i>United
Service Magazine</i> for April, 1892. The complete network
of railways covering these islands, admirably equipped and
efficiently worked as they were, would, he declared, be
found equal to any part they might be called upon to play
in a scheme of national defence. As regarded the attention
already paid to the question he said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The War Office, so far from having in any way neglected the
subject, have devoted considerable attention to it, and a complete
scheme for the working of our railways for transport purposes
in time of war has been elaborated, and would at once be put in
operation, if ever the emergency arose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Passing on to describe the composition and duties of the
Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps, he spoke of
its members as meeting in council at their headquarters to
discuss from time to time details of railway organisation
and other matters delegated to their consideration, afterwards
reporting their conclusions to the War Office; and
he went on to say that for the operation of the railways,
under State control, on any occasion of national energy
or danger&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A draft scheme has been prepared, has been worked out in
detail, and would, in all probability, be adopted and put in
operation if, unhappily, the necessity should ever arise.</p>

<p>This scheme in its main features provides that, at such time
as we are contemplating, the principal railway officials in Great
Britain and Ireland would at once become, for the time being,
the officers of the State, and in addition to the general managers
of the leading railways, who are officers of the Engineer and
Railway Volunteer Staff Corps, military rank of some kind
would be conferred upon the engineers, locomotive superintendents,
chief passenger superintendents and goods managers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>principal railway companies, as well as on the managers of the
principal Irish railways.</p>

<p>The railways of the country would be divided into sections,
and for each section there would be a committee composed of the
general managers of the railways included in the section, together
with the principal engineers, locomotive superintendents and
other chief officers. The railways would be worked and controlled
for military purposes by these committees of sections, each
committee having as its president a Lieutenant-Colonel of the
Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps, who would be
directly responsible for providing transport for troops and stores
over the section of which his committee had charge, while if the
operation to be carried out required the co-operation of one or
more sections of the railways, the committees of those sections
would act in unison. In such a case the Quartermaster-General's
requisition for the service to be performed would be made upon
the president of the section embracing the point of departure,
that officer and his committee taking the initiative and arranging
with the other committees for the performance of the service.</p>

<p>For each section, or group, of railways, a military officer of rank
would be appointed, with full power to arrange for food, forage
and water for the troops and horses <i>en route</i>, and having at his
disposal a sufficient number of soldiers or labourers to assist in
loading and unloading baggage, stores, etc., at the points of
entrainment and detrainment within his section. He would also
be able to command the services of the Royal or Volunteer
Engineers to assist in the erection of temporary platforms or
landings, or the laying down of temporary rails, and would be
instructed to co-operate with, and assist in every way, the
committee of section having charge of his district, but not in any
way to attempt to interfere with the working of the line or the
movement of the trains or traffic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The number of sections into which the railways were to
be divided for the purposes of this scheme was nine. After
defining the various areas, Sir George continued:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is contemplated that during any such period of crisis as
we are now discussing, the Council of the Engineer and Railway
Volunteer Staff Corps would be sitting <i xml:lang="fr">en permanence</i> at its headquarters,
and, with a full knowledge of the nature and extent of
the operations to be carried out, would have power to regulate
the supply and distribution of rolling stock throughout the area
affected, all the vehicles in the country being, for the time being,
treated as a common stock.</p>

<p>This is a mere outline of the scheme, with the further details of
which it is not necessary to trouble the reader, though probably
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>enough has been said to show that the subject, far from having
been neglected, as Colonel Rothwell appears to assume, has been
carefully studied and thought out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Had the scheme in question been matured and adopted
on the lines here stated, a still greater degree of importance
would have been attached to the position and proceedings
of a Corps then&mdash;and still&mdash;almost unknown to the world
at large, since its chief function was to carry out investigations
at the request of the authorities, and prepare reports,
statements and statistics which have invariably got no
further than the War Office and the Horse Guards, where,
alone, the value of the services rendered has been fully
understood and appreciated. The scheme was, however,
allowed to drop, the policy eventually adopted being based,
preferably, (1) on the railways of Great Britain being operated
in war time as one group instead of in a series of groups
or sections; and (2) on such operation being entrusted to
a body specially created for the purpose; though prior
to the adoption of the latter course there was to be a fresh
development in another direction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The War Railway Council</span></h3>

<p>While the Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps
remained, down to 1896, the only organised body which
(apart from the individual railway companies) Government
departments could consult as to the technical working
and traffic facilities of the railways, from the point of
view of military transport, it was thought desirable, in the
year mentioned, to supplement that Corps by a smaller
body known at first as the "Army Railway Council"
and afterwards as the "War Railway Council."</p>

<p>Designed to act in a purely advisory capacity, without
assuming any administrative or executive functions, this
Council was eventually constituted as follows:&mdash;The Deputy
Quartermaster-General (president); six railway managers,
who represented the British railway companies and might
or might not already be members of the Engineer and
Railway Staff Corps; one Board of Trade Inspector of
Railways; two members (not being railway managers)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps; the Deputy-Assistant
Quartermaster-General; one mobilisation officer;
two Naval officers; and one officer of the Royal Engineers,
with a representative of the Quartermaster-General's
Department as secretary.</p>

<p>The Council approximated closely to the "<span xml:lang="fr">Commission
Militaire Superieure des Chemins de Fer</span>" in France, of
which an account has been given in Chapter IX. It also
undertook many of the duties which in the case of the
German Army would be performed by a special section of
the General Staff; though some of these duties it took over
from the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, reducing the
functions and the importance of that body proportionately.</p>

<p>In time of peace the Council was (1) generally to advise
the Secretary of State for War on matters relating to military
rail-transport; (2) to draw up, in conjunction with the
different railway companies concerned, and on the basis
of data to be supplied to them by the War Office, a detailed
scheme for the movement of troops on mobilisation; (3)
to arrange in advance as to the composition of the trains
which would be required for any such movement; (4) to
determine the nature of the data to be asked for from the
railway companies,<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and to prepare the necessary regulations
and instructions in regard to the said troop movements;
(5) to draw up rules for the organisation of a body
of Railway Staff Officers who, located at railway stations
to be selected by the Council, would act there as intermediaries
between the railway officials and the troops;
and (6) to confer with the different railway companies as
to the provision of such extra sidings, loading platforms,
ramps, barriers, etc., as might be necessary to facilitate
military transport, and to decide on the best means by
which the provision thereof could be arranged. Information
on these subjects was to be carefully compiled, elaborated,
and, with explanatory maps, placed on record for use
as required.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>In the event of mobilisation, or of some national emergency,
the Council was, also, to advise the Secretary of
State for War in regard to matters relating to the movement
of troops by rail; to act as a medium of communication
between the War Office and the railway companies,
and to make all the necessary arrangements in connection
with such movements.</p>

<p>Other questions likely to arise, and requiring consideration
in time of peace, included the guarding of the railways
against possible attack; the prompt repair of any damage
that might be done to them; the equipment of armoured
trains, and the provision of ambulance trains on lines where
they might be required.</p>

<p>All these and various other matters were dealt with at the
periodical meetings held by the Council, which, within
the range of its limitations as an advisory body, rendered
good service to the War Office; though that Department
was still left to deal with the individual railway companies
in regard to all arrangements and matters of detail directly
concerning them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Railway Transport Officers</span></h3>

<p>In the foregoing statement as to the functions to be
discharged by the War Railway Council it is mentioned
that these were to include the drawing up of rules for the
organisation of a body of Railway Staff Officers who were
to act as intermediaries between the troops and the railway
station staffs in the conduct of military rail-transport.</p>

<p>We touch here upon those questions of control and organisation
of military traffic which had been a fruitful source
of trouble in earlier wars, and more especially so on the
French railways in the war of 1870-71. There was, indeed,
much wisdom in the attempt now being made, as a precautionary
measure, to provide well in advance against
the risk of similar experiences in regard to movements
of British troops by rail, while the course adopted led to
the creation of a system which was to ensure excellent
results later on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first instance the officers appointed under the
system here in question were known as "Railway Control
Officers," (R.C.O.'s,) their chief as the "Director of Railways,"
(D.R.,) and the organisation itself as the "Railway
Control Establishment"; but the titles of Railway
Transport Officers (R.T.O.'s), Director of Railway Transport
(D.R.T.) and Transport Establishments were afterwards
substituted.</p>

<p>The functions of the Director of Railway Transport
are thus defined in Field Service Regulations, Part II,
section 23 (1913):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Provision of railway transport and administration of railway
transport personnel. Control, construction, working and maintenance
of all railways. Provision of telegraph operators for
railway circuits. Control and working of telephones and telegraphs
allotted to the railway service. For the erection and
maintenance of all telegraph circuits on railways which are worked
by the troops, a representative of the Director of Army Signals
will be attached to his headquarters and the necessary signal
troops allotted to him as may be ordered by the I.G.C. (Inspector-General
of Communications).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As regards the Railway Transport Establishments, the
Regulations say (section 62):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In railway matters, the authority of each member of a railway
transport establishment will be paramount on that portion of a
railway system where he is posted for duty.</p>

<p>Railway technical officials will always receive the demands
of the troops for railway transport through the railway transport
establishment.</p>

<p>Except when fighting is imminent or in progress, a member of
the railway transport establishment will receive orders from the
Director of Railway Transport only, or his representative.</p>

<p>An officer, or officers, of the railway transport establishment,
recognized by a badge worn on the left arm marked R.T.O., will
be posted for duty at each place where troops are constantly
entraining, detraining, or halting <i>en route</i>. Their chief duties
will be:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. To facilitate the transport of troops, animals and material.</p>

<p>2. To act as a channel of communication between the military
authorities and the technical railway personnel.</p>

<p>3. To advise the local military authorities as to the capacity
and possibilities of the railway.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>4. To bring to the notice of the Director of Railway Transport
any means by which the carrying power of the railway
may, for military purposes, be increased.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All details as to the entraining and detraining of troops and the
loading and unloading of stores will be arranged in conjunction
with the technical officials by the railway transport establishment,
who will meet all troops arriving to entrain, inform commanders
of the times and places of entrainment, and allot trucks
and carriages to units in bulk. They will see that the necessary
rolling stock is provided by the railway officials, that only the
prescribed amount of baggage is loaded, and that no unauthorised
person travels by rail. They will meet all troop trains,
and see that troops and stores are detrained with the utmost
despatch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will be observed from these regulations that, whatever
his own rank may be, the R.T.O., subject to the instructions
he has received from his superior Transport Officer,
exercises at the railway station to which he is delegated an
authority that not even a General may question or seek
to set aside by giving orders direct to the station staff. The
R.T.O. alone is the "channel of communication" between
the military and the railway elements. He it is who, acting
in conjunction with the railway people, must see that all
the details in connection with entraining and detraining
are properly arranged and efficiently carried out, while the
operations of the station staff are, in turn, greatly facilitated
alike by his co-operation and by the fact that there
is now only one military authority to be dealt with at a
station instead, possibly, of several acting more or less
independently of one another.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Volunteer Reviews</span></h3>

<p>While all these developments had been proceeding, the
railway companies had, since the formation of the Engineer
and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps, given repeated evidence
of their capacity to move large bodies of Volunteers with
complete efficiency. They specially distinguished themselves
in this respect on the occasion of the great Volunteer
reviews held from time to time. In a book entitled "England's
Naval and Military Weakness," (London, 1882,)
Major James Walter, of the 4th Lancashire Artillery Volunteers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
was highly eulogistic of what was done by the railways
on the occasion of the reviews in Edinburgh and Windsor
in 1881. In regard to the Windsor review he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The broad result has been, so far as the railway part of the
business goes, to prove that it is perfectly feasible to concentrate
fifty thousand men from all parts of the kingdom in twenty-four
hours.... The two lines most concerned in the Windsor
review&mdash;the Great Western and the South Western&mdash;carried out
this great experiment with ... the regularity and dispatch of
the Scotch mail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Walter seems to have had the idea, rightly or
wrongly, that the success of this performance was mainly
due to the Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps.
He says concerning that body:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not the least valued result of the Windsor and Edinburgh
reviews of 1881 is the having introduced with becoming prominence
to public knowledge the necessary and indispensable services
of the "Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps." Until
these reviews bore testimony to the national importance of this
Corps, few knew anything of its duties, or even existence, beyond
a list of officers recorded in the Army List.... Since the
embodiment of the Volunteers the Engineer and Railway Transport
Corps has done much service, invariably thorough and without
a hitch.... These several officers of the Railway Staff
Corps set about their transport work of the 1881 reviews in a
manner worthy of their vocation. They proved to the country
that their Corps was a reality and necessity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1893 the authors of the "Army Book for the British
Empire" wrote (p. 531):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is every reason to believe that, in case of the military
forces in the United Kingdom being mobilised for the purposes
of home defence, and being concentrated in any part or parts of
the country for the purpose of guarding against or confronting
an invasion, the railway arrangements would work satisfactorily.
The remarkable success which has attended the concentration of
large bodies of Volunteers gathered from all quarters of the
Kingdom for military functions and reviews, on more than one
occasion, has shown the extraordinary capabilities of the British
railway system for military transport on a great scale. Rolling
stock is abundant. The more important lines in England have
a double line of rails; some have four or more rails. Gradients,
moreover, as a rule are easy, an important point, since troop
trains are very heavy.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The South African War</span></h3>

<p>While no one was likely to dispute these conclusions, it
had to be remembered that the transport by rail even of
exceptionally large bodies of Volunteers, carrying their
rifles only, was a very different matter from the conveyance,
under conditions of great pressure, of large forces of troops
accompanied by horses, guns, ammunition, road wagons,
stores and other necessaries for prospective actual warfare.
So the accepted capacity of the British railways had still
to stand the test of actual war conditions, with or without
the accompaniment of invasion; and this test was applied,
to a certain extent, by the South African War.</p>

<p>The bulk of the military traffic on that occasion passed
over the lines of the London and South Western Railway
Company, troops from all parts of the country being conveyed
by different routes and different lines of railway to
Southampton, whence they and their stores, etc., were
shipped to the Cape. Such was the magnitude of this
traffic that between the outbreak of the war, in 1899, and
the end of 1900 there were carried on the London and South
Western, and despatched from Southampton, 6,160 officers;
229,097 men; 29,500 horses; and 1,085 wheeled vehicles.
The conveyance of this traffic involved the running of 1,154
special trains, in addition to a large number of others carrying
baggage, stores, etc. At times the pressure was very
great. On October 20, 1899, five transports sailed from
Southampton with 167 officers and 4,756 men, besides guns
horses and wagons. Yet the whole of the operations were
conducted with perfect smoothness, there being no overtaxing
either of the railway facilities or of the dock accommodation.<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Much of this smoothness of working was due to the fact
that the War Office had, in accordance with the principle
adopted on the appointment of the War Railway Council,
stationed at Southampton a Railway Transport Officer who
was to act as a connecting link, or intermediary, between
the railway, the docks, the military and the Admiralty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
authorities, co-ordinating their requirements, superintending
the arrivals by train, arranging for and directing the
embarkation of the troops and their equipment in the transports
allotted to them, and preventing any of that confusion
which otherwise might well have arisen. Similar officers
had also been stationed by the War Office at leading railway
stations throughout the country to ensure co-operation between
the military and the railway staffs and, while avoiding
the possibility of friction or complications, facilitate the
handling of the military traffic.</p>

<p>In the account to be given in Chapter XVI. of "Railways
in the Boer War," it will be shown that a like course was
pursued in South Africa for the duration of the campaign.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Army Man&oelig;uvres of 1912</span></h3>

<p>Further evidence as to what the British railways were
capable of accomplishing was afforded by the Army Man&oelig;uvres
in East Anglia in 1912. This event also constituted a
much more severe test than the Volunteer reviews of former
days, since it meant not only the assembling, in the man&oelig;uvre
area, of four divisions of the Army and some thousands
of Territorials, but the transport, at short notice, and within
a limited period, of many horses, guns, transport wagons,
etc., together with considerable quantities of stores. Certain
sections of the traffic were dealt with by the Great
Northern and the London and North-Western Companies;
but the bulk of it was handled by the Great Eastern and was
carried in nearly 200 troop trains, consisting in all of about
4,000 vehicles. Of these trains 50 per cent. started before
or exactly to time, while the others were only a few minutes
late in leaving the station. Such was the regularity and
general efficiency with which the work of transportation
was carried out that in the course of an address to the
Generals, at Cambridge, his Majesty the King referred to
the rapid concentration of troops by rail, without dislocating
the ordinary civilian traffic, as one of the special features of
the man&oelig;uvres. The dispersal of the forces on the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of the man&oelig;uvres was effected in a little over two days,
and constituted another smart piece of work.<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Railways Executive Committee</span></h3>

<p>In view of all such testimony and of all such actual
achievements, there was no reason to doubt that the railway
companies, with their great resources in material and personnel,
and with the excellence of their own organisation,
would themselves be able to respond promptly and effectively
to such demands as might be made upon them in a
time of national emergency.</p>

<p>There still remained, however, the singular fact that
although, so far back as 1871, the Government had acquired
power of control over the railways, in the event of an emergency
arising, a period of forty years had elapsed without
any action being taken to create, even as a precautionary
measure, the administrative machinery by which that control
would be exercised by the State. Such machinery had
been perfected in Germany, France, and other countries,
but in England it had still to be provided. Not only had
section 16 of the Act of 1871 remained practically a dead
letter, but even the fact that it existed did not seem to be
known to so prominent a railway manager as Sir George
Findlay when he wrote "Working and Management of an
English Railway" and the article he contributed to the
<i>United Service Magazine</i> of April, 1892, his assumption that
the State would control the railways in time of war being
based, not on the Act of 1871&mdash;which he failed to mention&mdash;but
on the Act of 1888, which simply gives a right of
priority to military traffic, under certain conditions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<p>Notwithstanding, too, the draft scheme spoken of by Sir
George Findlay, under which the operation of the railways
was to be entrusted, in case of emergency, to the Engineer
and Railway Staff Corps, that body and, also, the War
Railway Council, continued to occupy a purely advisory
position.</p>

<p>So it was clearly desirable to supplement the recognized
efficiency of the railways themselves by the creation of a
central executive body which, whenever the State assumed
control of the railways, under the Act of 1871, would (1) secure
the necessary co-operation between Government
departments and the railway managements; (2) ensure
the working of the various railway systems on a national
basis; and (3) co-ordinate such various needs as naval and
military movements to or from all parts of the Kingdom;
coal supply for the Fleet; transport of munitions; the
requirements of the civil population, etc.</p>

<p>The necessity for this machinery&mdash;which could not possibly
be created at a moment's notice&mdash;became still more
apparent in the autumn of 1911, and steps were taken to
provide what was so obviously a missing link in the existing
organisation.</p>

<p>Thus it was that in 1912 the War Railway Council was
succeeded by a Railways Executive Committee which, constituted
of the general managers of leading railway companies,
was to prepare plans "with a view to facilitate the
working" of the provisions of the Act of 1871, and would,
also, in the event of the Government assuming control over
the railways of Great Britain, under the provisions of that
Act, constitute the executive body for working them on
behalf of the State, becoming the recognised intermediary (1)
for receiving the instructions of Government departments
in respect to military and naval requirements; and (2) for
taking the necessary measures in order to give effect to
them through the individual companies, each of which, subject
to the instructions it received from the Committee,
would retain the management of its own line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>In accordance with the principle thus adopted, it was
through the Railways Executive Committee that the Government,
subject to certain financial arrangements which need
not be dealt with here, established their control over the
railways of Great Britain on the outbreak of war in 1914,
the announcement to this effect issued from the War Office,
under date August 4, stating:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An Order in Council has been made under Section 16 of the
Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, declaring that it is expedient
that the Government should have control over the railroads in
Great Britain. This control will be exercised through an Executive
Committee composed of general managers of railways which
has been formed for some time, and has prepared plans with a
view to facilitating the working of this Act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a notification issued by the Executive Committee, of
which the official chairman was the President of the Board
of Trade and the acting chairman was Mr. (now Sir Herbert
A.) Walker, general manager of the London and South
Western Railway, it was further stated:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The control of the railways has been taken over by the Government
for the purpose of ensuring that the railways, locomotives,
rolling stock and staff shall be used as one complete unit in the
best interests of the State for the movement of troops, stores and
food supplies.... The staff on each railway will remain under
the same control as heretofore, and will receive their instructions
through the same channels as in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As eventually constituted, the Committee consisted of
the following general managers:&mdash;Mr. D. A. Matheson,
Caledonian Railway; Sir Sam Fay, Great Central Railway;
Mr. C. H. Dent, Great Northern Railway; Mr. F. Potter,
Great Western Railway; Mr. Guy Calthrop, London and
North Western Railway; Mr. J. A. F. Aspinall, Lancashire
and Yorkshire Railway; Sir Herbert A. Walker, London
and South Western Railway; Sir William Forbes, London,
Brighton and South Coast Railway; Sir Guy Granet, Midland
Railway; Sir A. K. Butterworth, North Eastern Railway,
and Mr. F. H. Dent, South Eastern and Chatham
Railway, with Mr. Gilbert S. Szlumper as secretary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">1860 AND 1914</span></h3>

<p>Such, then, was the final outcome of a movement which,
started in 1860, by individual effort, as the result of an
expected invasion of England by France, was, in 1914, and
after undergoing gradual though continuous development,
to play an important part on behalf of the nation in helping
France herself, now England's cherished Ally, to resist the
invader of her own fair territory.</p>

<p>With what smoothness the transport of our troops was
conducted cannot yet be told in detail; but the facts here
narrated will show that the success attained was mainly
due to three all-important factors,&mdash;(1) the efficiency of the
railway organisation; (2) the willingness of the Government,
on assuming control of the railways under the Act of
1871, to leave their management in the hands of railway
men; and (3) the ready adoption, alike by the railway
interests and by State departments, of the fundamental
principle enforced by a succession of wars from the American
Civil War of 1861-65 downwards,&mdash;that in the conduct
of military rail transport there should be, in each of its
various stages, intermediaries between the military and the
railway technical elements, co-ordinating their mutual
requirements, constituting the recognised and only channel
for orders and instructions, and ensuring, as far as prudence,
foresight and human skill can devise, the perfect working
of so delicate and complicated an instrument as the railway
machine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Railway Troops</span></h3>

<p>While Germany, inspired by the American example, had
begun the creation of special bodies of Railway Troops in
1866, it was not until 1882 that a like course was adopted
in England. Prior to the last-mentioned year it was, possibly,
thought that the labour branch of the Engineer and
Railway Volunteer Staff Corps would suffice to meet requirements
in regard to the destruction or the re-establishment of
railways at home in the event of invasion; but the arrangements
of the Corps did not provide for the supply of men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to take up railway construction and operation on the occasion
of military expeditions to other countries.</p>

<p>It was this particular need that led, in the summer of
1882, to the conversion of the 8th Company of Royal Engineers
into the 8th (Railway) Company, R.E., the occasion
therefore being the dispatch of an expeditionary force under
Sir Garnet (afterwards Lord) Wolseley to Egypt, where the
necessity for railway work of various kinds was likely to
arise. This pioneer corps of British Railway Troops was
formed of seven officers, one warrant officer, two buglers,
and ninety-seven N.C.O.'s and sappers. So constituted, it
was thought better adapted for railway work under conditions
of active service than a body of civilian railwaymen
would be. There certainly was the disadvantage that those
constituting the 8th were not then proficient in railway
matters; but, before they left, both officers and men were
given the run of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway
lines, and were there enabled to pick up what they could of
railway working in the locomotive and traffic departments,
while on the London and South Western and the South Eastern
Railways they were initiated, as far as could be done
in the time, into the art of platelaying. The Corps took out
to Egypt four small tank locomotives; two first-class, two
second-class and six third-class carriages; forty cattle
trucks; four brake vans; two travelling cranes; two
breakdown vans, and five miles of permanent way, complete,
with accessories, tools, etc. Excellent work was done
in carrying on regular train services, repairing damaged
track, etc., running an armoured train, constructing supplementary
short lines, and conveying troops, sick and wounded,
and stores, the practical utility of such an addition to the
engineering forces of the Army being thus fully assured.</p>

<p>In January, 1885, the 10th Company, Royal Engineers,
was converted into the 10th (Railway) Company, and sent
to Egypt to assist in the construction of the then contemplated
Suakin-Berber line, to which further reference will
be made in Chapter XV. Both companies also rendered
good service in the South African War.</p>

<p>According to the "Manual of Military Railways," issued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
with Army Orders dated March 1st, 1889, the duties likely
to be required from the Royal Engineers with regard to railways
are as follows:&mdash; (1) Laying, working, and maintaining
a military line of railway between two places; (2) restoring
an existing line which has been damaged or destroyed by
an enemy; (3) destroying an existing line as much as possible
with a given number of men and in a specified time,
and (4) working and maintaining an existing line. The
"Manual" itself gave much technical information as to the
construction, maintenance, destruction and working of railways.
It was re-issued by the War Office in 1898 as Part
VI of "Instruction in Military Engineering," and was
stated to embody a portion of the course of instruction in
railways at the school of Military Engineering, Chatham.
In the "Manual of Military Engineering," issued by the
General Staff of the War Office in 1905, instructions are
given (Chap. XVII, pars. 238-244) on the "hasty demolition,
without explosives," of railways, stations, buildings, rolling
stock, permanent way, water supply, etc.; and in Chapter
XXIII, "Railways and Telegraphs," the statement is made
that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The duties likely to be required of troops in the field with
regard to railways (apart from large railway schemes, for which
special arrangements would be necessary,) may be considered as
either temporary repairs or the laying of short lengths of line to
join up breaks, the construction of additional works, such as
platforms, etc., to adapt the line for military use, or the demolition
of an existing line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Detailed information is given, for the benefit of R.E.
officers, concerning railway construction, repair and reconstruction,
and the main principles on which such work
should be carried out for military purposes are explained.
The best system to adopt for the effecting of rapid
repairs is said to be that of establishing construction trains.
"The reconstruction staff live in these trains, which rapidly
advance along the line as it is being repaired, conveying,
also, the necessary material."</p>

<p>The peace training<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of the Companies includes: reconnaissance,
survey and final location of a railway; laying
out station yards; laying out deviations; rapid laying of
narrow-gauge "military" lines; construction of all kinds
of railway bridges; signal installation; water supply;
repairs to telegraphs and telephones necessary for working
construction lines; working of electric block instruments;
fitting up armoured trains; construction of temporary
platforms, and working and maintenance of construction
trains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
<p>Instruction in reconnaissance and survey work is given to
officers while at head-quarters, and a certain number of
N.C.O.'s and men are also instructed in railway survey work.
Parties, each commanded by an officer, are sent to carry out
a reconnaissance and final location of a railway between two
points about forty miles apart on the assumption that it is
an unmapped country, and complete maps and sections are
prepared. The Companies have also undertaken the construction
and maintenance of the Woolmer Instructional
Military Railway,&mdash;a 4 ft. 8&frac12; in. gauge military line, about
six miles in length, connecting Bordon (London and South
Western Railway) with Longmore Camp. All the plant
necessary for railway work and workshops for the repair
of rolling stock are provided at Longmore.</p>

<p>In time of war the chief duties of a Railway Company,
R.E., would be to survey, construct, repair and demolish
railways and to work construction and armoured trains.</p>

<p>In the South African campaign, when the military had
to operate the railways of which they took possession in the
enemy's country, some difficulty was experienced in obtaining
from the ranks of the Army a sufficient number of men
capable of working the lines. As the result of these conditions,
it was arranged, in 1903, between the War Office and
certain of the British railway companies that the latter
should afford facilities in their locomotive departments and
workshops for the training of a number of non-commissioned
officers and men as drivers, firemen and mechanics, (capable
of carrying out repairs,) in order to qualify them better for
railway work in the field, in case of need. This arrangement
was carried out down to the outbreak of war in 1914.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
The period of training lasted either six or nine months. In
order to avoid the raising of any "labour" difficulties, no
wages were given during this period to Army men who were
already receiving Army pay as soldiers, but a bonus was
granted to them by the railway companies, when they left,
on their obtaining from the head of the department to which
they had been attached a certificate of their efficiency.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strategical Railways</span></h3>

<p>The subject of strategical railways will be dealt with,
both generally and in special reference to their construction
in Germany, in Chapter XVIII. In regard to Great Britain
it may be said that the position as explained by Sir George
Findlay in his article in the <i>United Service Magazine</i> for
April, 1892, is that whilst Continental countries have been
spending large sums of money on the building of strategical
lines for the defence of their frontiers, (or, he might have
added, for the invasion, in some instances, of their neighbours'
territory,) Great Britain, more fortunate, possesses
already a system of railways which, though constructed
entirely by private enterprise, could not, even if they had
been laid out with a view to national defence, "have been
better adapted for the purpose, since there are duplicated
lines directed from the great centres of population and of
military activity upon every point of the coast, while there
are lines skirting the coast in every direction, north, east,
south and west."</p>

<p>Some years ago there were certain critics who recommended
the building of lines, for strategical purposes, along
sections of our coast which the ordinary railways did not
directly serve; but the real necessity for such lines was
questioned, the more so because the transport of troops by
rail on such short-distance journeys as those that would
have been here in question might, with the marching to
and from the railway and the time occupied in entraining
and detraining, take longer than if the troops either marched
all the way, or (in the event of there being only a small
force) if they went by motor vehicles to the coast.</p>

<p>One point that was, indeed, likely to arise in connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with the movement of troops was the provision of facilities
for their ready transfer from one railway system to another,
without change of carriage, when making cross-country
journeys or travelling, for instance, from the North or the
Midlands to ports in the South.</p>

<p>We have seen that in France many such links were established,
subsequent to the war of 1870-71, expressly for
strategical reasons; but in Great Britain a like result has
been attained, apart from military considerations, from
the fact that some years ago the different railway companies
established physical connections between their different
systems with a view to the ready transfer of ordinary traffic.
When, therefore, the necessity arose for a speedy mobilisation,
or for the transport of troops from any part of Great
Britain to any particular port for an overseas destination,
the necessary facilities for through journeys by rail, in the
shortest possible time, already existed.</p>

<p>In effect, the nearest approach to purely strategical
lines in Great Britain is to be found, perhaps, in those
which connect military camps with the ordinary railways;
yet, while these particular lines may have been built to
serve a military purpose, they approximate less to strategical
railways proper, as understood in Germany, than to
branch lines and sidings constructed to meet the special
needs of some large industrial concern.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the attitude of Parliament and of
British authorities in general has not been sympathetic
to suggestions of strategical railways, even when proposals
put forward have had the support of the War Office itself.</p>

<p>This tendency was well shown in connection with the
Northern Junction Railway scheme which was inquired
into by a Select Committee of the House of Commons
in 1913. Under the scheme in question, a railway was
to be constructed from Brentford, on the west of London,
to Wood Green, on the north, passing through Acton,
Ealing, Wembley Park, Hampstead and Finchley, and
establishing connections with and between several of the
existing main-line systems. In this respect it compared
with those "outer circle" railway systems which, as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
further result of the war of 1870-71, were expressly designed
by the French Government for the better defence of Paris.</p>

<p>The Northern Junction scheme was introduced to the
Select Committee as one which, among other considerations,
"would be important from a military point of view
for moving troops from one point to another without
taking them through London." Lieut.-General Sir J. S.
Cowans, Quartermaster-General, a member of the Army
Council responsible for the movement of troops, and
deputed by the Secretary for War to give evidence, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The proposed line would be a great advantage in time of emergency
if it was constructed in its entirety. The Army Council felt
that it would provide important routes between the South of
England and East Anglia and the North. At present trains had
to come from Aldershot to Clapham Junction by the South-Western
line, and be there broken up and sent over congested
City lines on to the Great Northern. By the proposed line
military trains could be handled without dividing them and be
transferred to the Great Northern or Great Eastern without
being sent over the congested City lines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strong opposition was offered, however, on the ground
that the construction of the line would do "irreparable
damage" to the amenities of the Hampstead Garden
Suburb; and, after a sitting which extended over several
days, the Committee threw out the Bill, the Chairman subsequently
admitting that "they had been influenced very
largely by the objection of the Hampstead Garden Suburb."</p>

<p>In 1914 the scheme was introduced afresh into the
House of Commons, with certain modifications, the proposed
line of route no longer passing through the Hampstead
Garden Suburb, though near to it. One member
of the House said he had collaborated in promoting the
Bill because "he most earnestly believed this railway was
of vital import to the mobilisation of our troops in time of
emergency"; but another declared that the alleged military
necessity for the railway was "all fudge," while much
was now said as to the pernicious effect the line would have
on the highly-desirable residential district of Finchley. In
the result strategical considerations were again set aside, and
the House rejected the Bill by a majority of seventy-seven.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Colonel McMurdo had special qualifications for the post. Becoming
a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army in October, 1853, he was
Assistant-Adjutant-General at Dublin from May, 1854, to January,
1855. On February 2, 1855, he was entrusted with the duties of
Director-General of the new Land-Transport Corps, and was sent
out to the Crimea, with the local rank of Colonel, to reorganize the
transport service, then in a deplorably defective condition. He is
said to have accomplished this task with great energy and success.
Before the close of the campaign his corps numbered 17,000 men,
with 28,000 horses, mules, etc. He also took over the working of the
pioneer military railway in the Crimea. In 1857 the Land-Transport
Corps was converted into the Military Train, with Colonel McMurdo
as Colonel-Commandant. Early in 1860, when the Volunteer
movement was assuming a permanent character, Colonel McMurdo
was appointed Inspector of Volunteers, and in June of the same year
he became Inspector-General, a post he retained until January, 1865.
He was chosen as Colonel of the Inns of Court Volunteers on January
23, 1865, and his further appointment to the post of Colonel of the
newly-formed Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps followed,
as stated above, in February, 1865. He was created K.C.B. in
1881 and G.C.B. in 1893. He died in 1894.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="smcap">Military Railways</span></h2>


<p>By the expression "military railways" is meant lines
of railways which, as distinct from commercial lines serving
public purposes, have been designed expressly for military
use. The fact that any line forming part of the ordinary
railway system of the country is employed for the conveyance
of troops either direct to the theatre of war or to some
port for embarkation therefrom does not constitute that
line a "military" railway, in the strict sense of the term,
whatever the extent of its use for military transport for
the time being. Such line remains a commercial railway,
all the same, and the application to it of the designation
"military" is erroneous.</p>

<p>Military railways proper fall mainly into two groups&mdash;(1)
"field" or "siege" railways, constructed on the theatre
of war for moving heavy guns, platform materials, etc., to
their position; conveying ammunition and supplies to siege
batteries, magazines, advanced trenches or bombproofs;
bringing up reinforcements rapidly in case of a sortie;
conveying working-parties to and from their work; removing
sick and wounded to the rear, and other kindred purposes,
the loads being generally hauled by animals, by
gasoline motor or by men; and (2) "supply" railways,
specially constructed to convey troops, stores, etc., from
the base to the front, in time of war, or from an ordinary
main-line railway to a military camp or depôt in time of
peace, where local lines of railway are not available for
the purpose.</p>

<p>These two main groups include various types of railways
coming under one or the other designation, and ranging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
from a very light portable tramway, put down at express
speed to serve an emergency, and worked by small engines,
mules or horses, to substantially built lines, of standard gauge,
designed both to be worked by locomotives and to carry the
largest possible number of troops or amount of freight.</p>

<p>In any case, the details of construction, equipment and
operation of a military railway vary from those of a commercial
railway since the one would be intended to serve
only a specific and possibly temporary purpose, in the attainment
of which the question of speed would be a secondary
consideration, whereas the other would require to assume a
permanent form, be capable of higher speeds, and afford
adequate guarantee of safety for the public, by whom it
would be used. The building, also, of a military railway
may be, and generally is, carried out by a corps of Railway
Troops to which are specially delegated the duties of laying,
working, maintaining, repairing, restoring or destroying
railways; and, provided the desired lines were built with
sufficient dispatch, and answered the desired purpose,
the military commanders who would alone be concerned
might well be satisfied.</p>

<p>In many different ways the resort to military railways,
whatever their particular type, has greatly extended the
range of advantages to be gained from the application of
rail-power to war. A full record of all that has been accomplished
in this direction could hardly be attempted here;
but a few typical examples of what has been done in this
direction&mdash;though not always with conspicuous success&mdash;may
be offered.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Crimean War</span></h3>

<p>The earliest instance of a purely military railway being
constructed to serve the purpose of a campaign occurred
in the Crimean War; and, although the line then made
would to-day be regarded as little more than an especially
inefficient apology for a railway, it was looked upon at the
time as a remarkable innovation in warfare. It further
established a precedent destined to be widely followed in
later years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the camp of the allies at Sebastopol and their
base of supplies at Balaklava the distance was only seven
or eight miles; yet in the winter of 1854-55 the fatigue
parties sent for rations, clothing, fuel, huts, ammunition
and other necessaries were frequently no less than twelve
hours in doing the return journey. The reason was that
during the greater part of that time they were floundering
in a sea of mud. The soil of the Crimea is clay impregnated
with salt, and, under the combined influence of climatic
conditions and heavy traffic, the route between camp and
base had been converted into a perfect quagmire. Horses,
mules and carts were, at first, alone available for transport
purposes; but, although plenty of animals were to be
obtained in the surrounding country, only a limited number
could be employed by reason of the lack of forage, a totally
inadequate supply having been sent out from England.
As for the animals that were used, their sufferings, as the
result of those terrible journeys, their own shortage of food,
and the effect of the intense cold on their half-starved
bodies, were terrible. "In the rear of each Division,"
says General Sir Edward Hamley, in "The War in the
Crimea," "a scanty group of miserable ponies and mules,
whose backs never knew what it was to be quit of the saddle,
shivered, and starved, and daily died." They died, also,
on every journey to or from the base. The toil of going
through the quagmire even for their own forage, or of
bringing it back when they had got it, was too great for
them, and the whole line of route was marked by their
remains.</p>

<p>As for the troops, they experienced great hardships owing
to the inadequate supplies of provisions and fuel at the
camp, although there might be plenty of both at the base.
Apart from the physical conditions of the roads, or apologies
for roads, between the two points, the campaign was begun
without transport arrangements of any kind whatever. A
transport corps formed for the British Army in 1799, under
the title of the Royal Wagon Train, had been disbanded in
1833, and, whether from motives of economy or because
the need for war preparations in time of peace was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
sufficiently appreciated, no other corps had been created
to take its place. Hence the troops sent to the Crimea
were required, at the outset, to look after the transport
themselves, and in many instances they even had to do the
work of mules and horses. It was not until January 24,
1855, that a Land Transport Corps, composed of volunteers
from various arms of the service, was raised by Royal
Warrant and began to provide for a defect in the military
organisation which had, in the meantime, involved the allies,
and especially the British, in severe privations owing to the
frequent shortage of supplies. The original intention to
establish a depôt at head-quarters before Sebastopol had
had to be abandoned because of the hopelessness of any
attempt to get a sufficient surplus of provisions to form a
store.</p>

<p>Such were the conditions that the pioneer military railway
was designed to remedy. Built, at a very slow rate,
by English contractors, who arrived at the Crimea with
their men and material during the month of January, 1855,
the line was a single-track one, with a 4 feet 8&frac12; inch gauge.
For the first two miles from Balaklava it was worked by a
locomotive. Then the trucks were drawn up an incline,
eight at a time, by a stationary engine. Six horses next
drew two trucks at a time up another incline. After this
came a fairly level piece of road, followed by two gullies
where each wagon was detached in succession and made to
run down one side of the gully and up the other by its own
momentum. Then horses were again attached to the
trucks and so drew them, finally, to the end of the line
on the Upland.</p>

<p>Five locomotives, of from 12 to 18 tons weight, were
provided, and there were about forty ordinary side-tip
ballast wagons&mdash;all entirely unsuitable for use on a military
railway.</p>

<p>At first the men belonging to the contractors' staff&mdash;navvies
and others&mdash;were entrusted with the working of
the line. The question had been raised as to whether their
services should not be made use of in other directions, as
well. On their being sent out from England the idea was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
entertained that they might construct trenches and batteries,
in addition to building the railway, and there was a suggestion
that they should, also, join the siege parties in the
attack on Sebastopol. In order to test the question (as
recorded by Major-General Whitworth Porter, in his
"History of the Corps of Royal Engineers"), Sir John
Burgoyne wrote to Mr. Beattie, principal engineer of the
Railway Department, asking if he would approve of an
invitation being given to the men to undergo such training
as would qualify them to defend any position in which they
might happen to be. In his answer Mr. Beattie wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The subject of your letter was very fully and anxiously discussed
in London before I left, and it was determined <i>not</i> to
arm the men. They were considered too valuable to be used
as soldiers, and were distinctly told that they would not be
called upon to fight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their value, however, did not stand the test it underwent
when they were called on to work the railway they had
built. They were found to be lacking in any sense of discipline;
they repeatedly struck work when their services
were most urgently needed, and they had to be got rid
of accordingly. They were replaced by men from the
Army Works Corps and the Land Transport Corps, then
in operation in the Crimea, and the members of the new
staff&mdash;constituting a disciplined force&mdash;worked admirably.
Major Powell, who became traffic manager of the line in
March, 1855, and chief superintendent in the following
July, has said concerning them<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Many lost their lives in the execution of their duty. When I
required them to work night and day to throw forward supplies
for the great struggle&mdash;the capture of Sebastopol&mdash;several of
them remained seventy-two hours continuously at work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quantities of ammunition and stores which could be
carried were below the requirements of the troops engaged
in the siege operations; but during the last bombardment
of Sebastopol&mdash;when the line was worked continuously,
night and day, by a staff increased to about 1,000 men, of
whom 400 were Turks&mdash;the transport effected rose from
200 tons a day, the limit attained under operation by the
undisciplined navvies, to 700 tons. The line also did
excellent work on the re-embarkment of the troops at the
end of the campaign.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">American Civil War</span></h3>

<p>In the American War of Succession, the existing lines of
railway were supplemented in various instances by "surface
railroads," which consisted of rails and sleepers laid on the
ordinary ground without any preparation of a proper road
bed, yet serving a useful purpose, notwithstanding the
rough and ready way in which they were put together.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Abyssinian Campaign</span></h3>

<p>How a railway specially constructed for the purpose
may assist a military expedition in the prosecution of a
"little war" in an uncivilised country, practically devoid
of roads, and offering great physical difficulties, was shown
on the occasion of the British Campaign in Abyssinia in
1867-68; though the circumstances under which the line in
question was built were not in themselves creditable to the
authorities concerned.</p>

<p>Sent to effect the release of the British prisoners whom
King Theodore was keeping in captivity at Magdala, the
expedition under Sir Robert Napier (afterwards Lord
Napier of Magdala) entered upon what was to be quite as
much an engineering as a military exploit. Not only was
Magdala 300 miles from Annesley Bay, the base of operations
on the Red Sea, but it stood, as a hill fortress, on a
plateau more than 9,000 feet above the sea-level. To reach
it meant the construction of roads in three sections. The
first, which, in parts, had to be cut in the mountain side,
rose to a height of 7,400 feet in 63 miles; the second allowed
of no more than a cart road, and the third and final stage
was a mere mountain track where the only transport possible
was that of mules or elephants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>When, in October, 1867, the advance Brigade landed at
Zoulla, the port in Annesley Bay from which the advance
inland was to be made, they took with them the materials
for some tramway lines intended to connect two landing
piers with the depôts it was proposed to establish a mile
inland. In November these plans were altered in favour
of a line of railway, twelve miles in length, from the landing-place
to Koomayleh, at the entrance of the Soroo Pass, the
route to be taken by the expedition on its journey to the
Abyssinian highlands. All the necessary plant was to be
supplied by the Government of Bombay, who also undertook
to provide the labour; but it was the middle of January,
1868, before a real start could be made with the work.</p>

<p>Even then, as told by Lieut. Willans, R.E.,<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> who took
part in the expedition, the progress made was extremely
slow. The rails obtained from different railway companies
in India were of five different patterns, of odd lengths, and
varying in weight from 30 lb. to 65 lb. a yard. Some of
them had been in use many years on the harbour works at
Karachi, had been taken up and laid down several times,
and had, also, been bent to fit sharp curves or cut to suit
the original line. Some single-flanged rails had been fitted
in the Government workshops at Bombay with fish-plates
and bolts; but the holes in the plates and rails were not at
uniform distances, and the bolts fitted the holes so tightly
as to allow of no play. Then, when the rails arrived, no
spikes came with them, and without spikes they could
not be laid. When the spikes followed, it was found that
the augurs for boring holes in the sleepers had been left at
Bombay, to come on by another ship; though this particular
difficulty was met by the artisans of the 23rd
Punjab Pioneer Regiment making augurs for themselves.</p>

<p>If the rails gave much trouble&mdash;and even when they had
been laid it was no unusual thing for them to break between
two sleepers and throw the engine off the line&mdash;the locomotives
and rolling stock caused still more.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p>Six locomotives were shipped from Bombay; but, owing
to the great difficulty in landing and the labour involved
in putting them together, only four were used. Of these,
one was a tank engine which, although just turned out from
the railway workshops at Bombay, required new driving
wheels after it had been running a fortnight. Another
came with worn-out boiler tubes, and these had to be replaced
at Zoulla. The two others, tank engines with only four
wheels each, had previously seen many years' service at
Karachi. All the engines were very light, weighing with
coal and water from 16 to 20 tons each. The best of them
could do no more than draw fifteen small loaded trucks
up an incline of one in sixty.</p>

<p>The sixty wagons sent were ordinary trolleys having no
springs, no spring buffers and no grease boxes. Their
axle-boxes were of cast iron, and wore out within a fortnight,
owing to the driving sand. As the railway came
into use, every truck was loaded to its fullest capacity,
and the combination of this weight with the jarring and
oscillation on a very rough line led either to the breaking of
the coupling chains or to the coupling bars being pulled from
the wagons at starting. When fresh coupling chains were
asked for it was found that the boxes containing them had
either been left behind at Bombay or were buried beneath
several hundred tons of other supplies on board ship. At
least forty per cent. of the trucks were either constantly
under repair or had to be put aside as unfit for use. In
May a number of open wagons with springs and spring
buffers arrived from Bombay. Some of these were converted
into passenger carriages.</p>

<p>Difficulties arose in other directions, besides.</p>

<p>The plant forwarded was adapted to the Indian standard
gauge of 5 feet 6 inches, and was heavy and difficult to
handle, especially under the troublesome conditions of
landing. To-day, of course, a narrow-gauge railway, easily
dealt with, would be employed in circumstances such as
those of the Abyssinian expedition.</p>

<p>The Indian natives who had been sent in the first instance
to construct the line were found unsuitable, and had to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
replaced by gangs of Chinese picked up in Bombay. The
latter worked well and gave no trouble.</p>

<p>The country through which the line was laid was timberless,
if not, also, practically waterless. Wells had to be
sunk for the water wanted for the locomotives and the
working-parties.</p>

<p>The heat was excessive. The temperature at times was
180 degrees Fahr. in the sun. English navvies could not
have made the line at all.</p>

<p>The two piers where the incoming vessels could alone be
unloaded got so congested with traffic that it was only with
the greatest trouble railway material could be landed.</p>

<p>Use began to be made of the line as soon as any of it was
ready, and the traffic at the shore end at once became so
heavy that it was difficult to get materials and supplies
through to the construction parties at the other end.
Officers, also, who should have been superintending the construction
had to devote a good deal of time, instead, to
details of operation, or to looking after the repairs of rolling
stock.</p>

<p>In all these circumstances one cannot be surprised at the
slow rate of progress made. One may, rather, wonder that
the line got built at all. As it was, four months were spent
on eleven miles of railway, or a total of twelve miles including
sidings. There remained still another mile or so to be
built when, at the end of April, news arrived that the object
of the expedition had been attained, and that Magdala
had fallen. It was then decided not to complete the line,
but to devote all energies to preparing for the heavy traffic
to be dealt with in the conveyance of troops, baggage and
stores on the return journey.</p>

<p>From the middle of May to the middle of June the resources
of the line were severely taxed; but a great improvement
had been made in the working arrangements, and
a railway which had involved so much trouble in the making
was eventually found to be of great practical service.
Lieutenant Willans says of it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Abyssinian railway was a great success, if one may gauge
it by the amount of assistance it gave to the expedition, by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>celerity and dispatch with which, by its aid, stores were landed
and brought up to the store sheds, and by the rapidity and ease
with which the troops and their baggage were brought back
and re-embarked at once....</p>

<p>As an auxiliary to the expedition, and as an additional means
of transport, no one who had anything to do in connection with
it can have doubted its extreme utility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Faulty, therefore, as had been the conditions under
which the line was constructed, the results nevertheless
established definitely the principle that, in such campaigns
as the one in Abyssinia, military railways might serve
an extremely useful purpose in facilitating the transport of
troops and supplies.</p>

<p>The Abyssinian experiences did, however, further show
the desirability of any country likely to find itself in a
position requiring the construction of military railways&mdash;as
an aid to wars small or great&mdash;creating in advance an
organisation designed to enable it, as far as possible, to
meet promptly whatever emergency might arise, without
the risk of having to deal with defective material, unsatisfactory
labour, and administrative mismanagement.</p>

<p>The same lesson was to be enforced by other expeditions
in which England has taken part, and, down to the period
when improvements in our system&mdash;or lack of system&mdash;began
to be effected, there was much scope for criticism as
to the way in which military railways, designed to facilitate
operations undertaken in countries having a lack of communications,
had been either constructed or worked. Writing,
in 1882, in the "Professional Papers" of the Royal Engineers
(Chatham) on "Railways for Military Communication in the
Field," Col. J. P. Maquay, R.E., observed in regard to
what had been the experiences to that date:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In most of the wars that England has undertaken during the
past thirty years, attempts have been made to construct railways
for the transport of stores and materials from the base
of operations. This base must necessarily be on the sea coast
for a country situated as England is. These railways have not
been successful chiefly because, when war had broken out, such
material was hastily got together as seemed most suitable to
the occasion; and, further, the construction of these lines was
not carried out on any system. It is not surprising, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>that our military railways were never completed in time to be
of much use to the troops they were intended to serve.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Franco-German War</span></h3>

<p>In the Franco-German War of 1870-71 the Germans
constructed two military railways&mdash;(1) a line, twenty-two
miles in length, connecting Remilly, on the Saarbrück
Railway, with Pont à Mousson, on the Metz-Frouard line;
and (2) a loop line, three miles long, passing round the
tunnel at Nanteuil, blown up by the French.</p>

<p>Special interest attached to these two lines inasmuch
as they were the result of construction work done, not in
anticipation of a war, or even immediately preceding
hostilities, but during the course of an active campaign.
In addition to this, they afforded an opportunity for showing
what Prussia could do, under pressure, with the Construction
Corps she had formed in order, among other
things, to meet just such contingencies as those that now
arose.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war the Prussian General Staff
had (according to Rüstow) assumed that Metz would offer
a prolonged resistance, and that the defenders would be
certain to make an attempt to interrupt the rail communication
between Germany and her troops in the field. To
meet the position which might thus be created, it was decided
to build from Pont à Mousson to Remilly a field railway
which, avoiding Metz, would link up at Remilly with the
line proceeding thence to Saarbrück, and so ensure the
maintenance of direct rail communication to and from
Germany. On August 14, 1870, the day of the rearguard
action at Borny, the survey and the levelling of the ground
were begun, and three days later a start was made with
the construction. Altogether some 4,200 men were employed
on the work, namely, 400 belonging to two Field
Railway Companies; 800 forming four Fortress Pioneer
Companies, and about 3,000 miners from the colliery districts
of Saarbrück who had been thrown out of work
owing to the war and accepted employment on the railway.
The building corps had at their disposal a park of 330<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
wagons and other vehicles, and patrol and requisition duties
were performed for them by a squadron of Cavalry.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that so considerable a force was available
for the purpose, the work of building the twenty-two
miles of railway took forty-eight days, the line not being
ready for operation until October 4. This was in no way a
great achievement, and it did not compare favourably with
much that was done by the Federal Construction Corps
employed in the American War of Secession. It is true
that the irregularities of the ground were such as to render
necessary numerous cuttings and embankments, and that
two bridges and two viaducts had to be provided; but the
cuttings were only about 3 feet deep, and the embankments
were only 5 feet high, except near one of the viaducts,
where they were 10 feet high. The viaducts and bridges were
of timber, with spans of about 16 feet. The building of the
line was, therefore, in no way a formidable undertaking,
from an engineering point of view.</p>

<p>Not only, however, did it take over 4,000 men nearly
fifty days to make twenty-two miles of line, but the work
had been done in such a way that when the autumn rains
came on the track settled in many places; traffic on the
lines became very dangerous; one of the bridges was
washed away by the floods, and almost as many men had
to be put on to do repairs as had previously been employed
for the construction. Traffic of a very moderate description&mdash;each
locomotive drawing only four wagons at a
time&mdash;was carried on for just twenty-six days, and then,
happily for the engineers concerned, the developments in
and around Metz rendered the line no longer necessary.</p>

<p>How the restoration of the traffic interrupted through the
explosion of French mines in the tunnel at Nanteuil occupied
from September 17 to November 22 has already been told
on page <a href="#Page_128">128</a>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Russo-Turkish War</span></h3>

<p>In the opinion of one English military critic, what short
lines were made in the Franco-German War "were neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
so speedily constructed nor so successful in result as to
encourage the idea that lines of any length could be made
during a campaign"; but a different impression is to be
derived from the story of what was accomplished in the same
direction in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78.</p>

<p>Russia planned her campaign against Turkey in the hope
and expectation that it would be short, sharp and decisive.
She started her mobilisation in good time, that is to say,
in November, 1876, although she did not declare war until
April 24, 1877. Making the mistake, however, of despising
her foe, she anticipated no serious opposition from the
Turks, but expected, rather, to paralyse them by a rapid
advance, have a triumphal march to Constantinople,
secure the desired safeguards for the Christians in Turkey,
and see the war over before the end of the summer.</p>

<p>One reason why Russia specially desired to bring the
campaign to so early a conclusion lay in the deficient and
precarious nature of the rail communication. Under a
convention which had been agreed to with Rumania on
April 16, 1877, Russia was to have a free passage for her
troops through that country. She was, also, to have the use
of the Rumanian railways and of all their transport facilities.
But the only line then running through Rumania was one
that went from Galatz, on the Russo-Rumanian frontier, to
Bucharest, and thence (with a branch to Slatina) to Giurgevo,
on the Danube, where it connected with a Bulgarian
line from Rustchuk, on the south of the river, to Varna,
the Turkish base of supplies on the Black Sea. Not only
was the Rumanian railway system thus limited in extent,
but the lines had been indifferently constructed, they were
badly maintained, and they had an inadequate personnel
together with an insufficiency both of rolling stock and of
terminal facilities. Still further, the fact that the Russian
railways had a broader gauge than the railways of Rumania
(among other European countries) caused great delay in
the transfer, at the frontier, from the one system to the
other, not alone of 200,000 men, but of the 850 field and
400 siege guns, of the ammunition, and of much other
material the troops required to take with them. The alternative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to dependence on the railway was a resort to roads
impassable in wet weather.</p>

<p>What really caused the Russian plans to miscarry, however,
was the obstinate defence of Plevna by Osman Pasha,
who took up his position there on July 19, subjected the
Russians to successive repulses, and did not capitulate
until December 10, the siege costing the Russians 55,000 men
and the Rumanians 10,000.</p>

<p>When it was realised that the check at Plevna rendered
certain a prolongation of the campaign, Russia set about
the construction of a series of new lines of railway during
the course of the war. The principal lines thus taken in
hand were:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A line in Russia, from Bender, on the Dniester, to
Galatz, establishing direct communication between the
Odessa railways and the Rumanian frontier, and affording
improved facilities for the sending of reinforcements to the
seat of war.</p>

<p>2. A line from Fratesti, on the Bucharest-Giurgevo Railway,
to Simnitza, the point on the north bank of the Danube
where, on the night of June 26-7, the Russians built the
bridge which enabled them to cross the river.</p>

<p>3. A line from Sistova, on the south side of the Danube,
to Tirnova (Bulgaria), situate about thirty miles south-east
of Plevna, and about twenty-five north of the Shipka Pass.</p>

<p>Of these three lines the construction of the first, 189
miles in length, was begun at the end of July, 1877. The
original intention was to build a railway to serve the purposes
of the war only; but the conclusion that ulterior
strategical and commercial purposes would alike be served
by linking up Odessa with the Rumanian frontier led to
the building of a railway likely to be of permanent usefulness.
The line was a single-track one, with a sufficient
number of stations and passing places to allow of the running
of seven trains in each direction in the twenty-four hours.
The construction, carried out by contract, involved the
building of a number of timber bridges and the provision
of several embankments, one of which was over three miles
in length. Great difficulties were experienced in regard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
to labour, and especially by reason of the refusal of the men
to work either on Sundays or on their numerous saints'
days. Trains were, nevertheless, running on the line within
100 days of the construction being started, and this notwithstanding
the fact that the number of actual working
days had been only fifty-eight. Whereas, therefore, the
Germans had, in 1870, with the help of a Construction Corps
over 4,000 strong, taken forty-eight days to build twenty-two
miles of railway between Pont à Mousson and Remilly, the
Russians in 1877 built, by contract, 189 miles of railway
in just over double the same period.</p>

<p>A railway from Fratesti to Simnitza had become indispensable
inasmuch as the main line of communication for
the Russian Army could not be continued for an indefinite
period along the forty miles of defective roads&mdash;speedily
worn out by the heavy traffic&mdash;which separated the Bucharest-Giurgevo
line from the bridge built across the Danube.
The only important earthwork necessary was an embankment
a mile and a half long and fourteen feet high. The
bridges to be provided included one of 420 feet and two of
210 feet each. In this instance the troubles experienced
were due to the difficulty in getting the necessary materials
for the work of construction owing partly to the existing
Rumanian lines being blocked with military traffic, and
partly to the state of the roads and to the use of all available
draught horses for Army transport purposes. There could
thus be no great celerity shown in construction, and the
forty miles of railway, begun in the middle of September,
were, in fact, not ready for working until the beginning of
December.</p>

<p>Like difficulties were experienced, though to a still more
acute degree, in regard to the Sistova-Tirnova line, the
length of which was to be seventy-five miles; and here only
the earthworks could be finished before the end of the
campaign.</p>

<p>What, however, had been accomplished during the time
the war was in progress was (1) the completion of 229 miles
of new railway, and the making of the road-bed for another
seventy-five miles, together with the carrying out of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
number of minor railway works; (2) the acquisition, by
purchase in different countries, of 120 locomotives and 2,150
wagons and trucks, all new, and (3) the provision of a
steam railway ferry across the Danube.<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>So the development of the rail-power principle in warfare
was carried still further by this construction, during the
course of the Russo-Turkish conflict, of a greater length of
railways, designed for military use, than had ever been
built under like conditions before. The world gained a
fresh lesson as to the importance of the rôle played by
railways in war, and it was offered, also, a striking example
of what could be done in the way of rapidly providing them
in a time of emergency.</p>

<p>On the other hand it had to be remembered that, of the
three railways in question, the one which included 189
miles out of the total 229 miles built was constructed on
Russian territory where there was no danger of interruption
by the enemy, while the delays which occurred with the two
other lines, owing to the congestion of traffic, under war
conditions, on existing railways depended upon for the
supply of materials, seemed to point (1) to the risk that might,
from this cause, be run if the building of lines necessary or
desirable in the interests of some prospective campaign
were left until the outbreak of hostilities, and (2) to the
wisdom of constructing all such lines, as far as necessary
and practicable, in time of peace.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Sudan</span></h3>

<p>If we turn now to the Sudan, we gain examples of military
railways which, designed for the purposes of war, and
constructed, in part, during the progress of active hostilities,
first rendered great services in facilitating the conquest of a
vast area, and then developed into a system of Government
railways operated, in turn, for the purposes of peace, and
accomplishing results as conspicuously successful in the
latter direction as they had previously done in the former.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>During the time that Saïd Pasha was Viceroy of Egypt
(1854-63) there was brought forward a scheme for the
linking up of Egypt and the Sudan by means of a single
line of railway from Cairo to Khartoum, with a branch to
Massowa, on the Red Sea. It was an ambitious proposal,
and, if it could have been carried into effect, the opening up
of the Sudan to civilisation, by means of an iron road,
might have altered the whole subsequent history of that
much-suffering land. But the cost was regarded as prohibitive,
and the scheme was abandoned for a time, to be
revived, however, in a modified form in 1871, when Ismail
Pasha was Khedive. It was then proposed that the line
should start at Wady Halfa and be continued to Matemmeh
(Shendy), situate about 100 miles north of Khartoum&mdash;a
total distance of 558 miles. In 1875 a beginning was made
with the building of this railway, which was to consist of a
single line, with a gauge of 3 feet 6 inches, and was to be
made with 50-lb. rails and 7-ft. sleepers; but when, in 1877,
after an expenditure of about £400,000, the railway had been
carried no farther than Sarras, thirty-three and a half
miles from the starting-point, it was stopped for lack of
funds.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1884 the British expedition to Khartoum,
where General Gordon was endeavouring to maintain
his position against the Mahdi's followers, was resolved
upon, and it was then decided to extend the Sudan Railway
beyond the point already reached, at Sarras, in order to
facilitate still further the journey of the troops along the
valley of the Nile, which had been selected as the route
of the expedition.</p>

<p>Platelaying for the extension was begun in September
by a party of English and Egyptian infantry and native
labourers, afterwards joined by the 4th Battalion Egyptian
Army and the 8th (Railway) Company of the Royal Engineers.
While, however, materials previously stored at
Sarras were found to be still available, the trucks containing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
rails, etc., for the extension work had to be pushed by hand
from Sarras to railhead owing to the absence of engines;
sleepers were carried on the backs of camels, of which 300
were employed for the purpose, and the coolie work was
entrusted to 700 native labourers, mainly old men and
boys, most of whom had deserted by the end of October,
when further platelaying was discontinued. By that
time the extension works had reached the thirty-ninth mile,
and the line from Sarras to this point was opened on December
4.</p>

<p>Following on the fall of Khartoum and the death of
Gordon in January, 1885, came the decision to extend the
line to Firket (103 miles), in view of a then projected further
campaign in the autumn of that year. The extension was
sanctioned towards the end of February; fifty-two miles
of permanent way were ordered from England; 300 platelayers
and railway mechanics were obtained from India, to
supplement the construction forces already available; and
on August 7 the extension was completed as far as Akasha
(87 miles).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, there had been a change of policy
which affected the whole situation. On the return of the
expeditionary force to Korti (situate at the southern extremity
of the great Nile bend), the whole of the country to
the south thereof passed under the control of the Dervishes;
and the British Government, reluctant at that
time to enter on the formidable task of reconquest, decided
that no further military operations should be taken in
hand, and that the Sudan must be definitely abandoned.
Orders were accordingly given by Lord Wolseley in May,
1885, for the withdrawal of the troops from all stations
south of Dongola, which itself was abandoned on June 15,
the retreat continuing as far as Akasha. Beyond this
point, therefore, platelaying for the proposed railway
extension was not carried, although the formation levels
had been completed to Firket.</p>

<p>Subsequently the British retreat was continued to Wady
Halfa, which then became the southern frontier of Egypt,
the railway extension thence to Akasha, together with all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
posts to the south of Wady Halfa, being also abandoned.</p>

<p>Excellent service had, nevertheless, been rendered by
the railway, as far as it was carried.</p>

<p>Operation of the line had been taken over by the 8th
(Railway) Company, R.E., who, at the outset, had at
their disposal only five more or less decrepit locomotives,
fifty open trucks, five covered goods vans, and six brake
vans. The troops were conveyed in the open trucks, and
by the end of 1884 all the stores for the opening of the
campaign had been passed up. During the course of 1885
additional locomotives and rolling stock were obtained
from the Cape.</p>

<p>Summing up the work done on the Sudan Military Railway
for the Nile Expedition of 1884-5, Lieut. M.
Nathan, R.E.,<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> says that it included (1) the repair and
maintenance of thirty-three and a half miles of existing
railway; (2) the construction of fifty-three and a half miles
of new line through a nearly waterless desert, with no means
of distributing material except the line itself; (3) the
transport, for the most part with limited and indifferent
stock, of about 9,000 troops round the worst part of the
second cataract when going up the river, and round nearly
the whole of it when coming down; and (4) the carriage
of 40,000 tons for an average distance of thirty-six and a
half miles.</p>

<p>As against what had thus been achieved in the Nile
Valley must be set a failure on the Red Sea.</p>

<p>When, on the fall of Khartoum in January, 1885, the
British Government first decided on an extension of the Nile
Valley Railway, they further resolved on the building of a
military railway from Suakin to Berber, on the Nile, in
order to have a second line of communication available for
Lord Wolseley's Army; and an Anglo-Indian force was
sent to Suakin, under the command of General Sir Gerald
Graham, in order, first, to defeat the Dervishes in the Eastern
Sudan, and then to protect the construction of the proposed
railway. Such a line would obviously have been of great
strategical value to a Nile expeditionary force; but the
attempt to build it broke down owing, in part, to the defective
nature of the organisation resorted to, though still
more to the active opposition of the enemy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir Andrew Clarke, Inspector-General of Fortifications,
had from the first advocated that the line should be supplied
and laid by the military engineering strength then
available; but he was over-ruled, and the work was given
to an English firm of contractors in the expectation, as
Major-General Whitworth Porter tells, in volume two of the
"History of the Corps of Royal Engineers," "that the
necessary material would be supplied more readily, and in
shorter time, through civilian agency." It was, however,
decided to send the 10th (Railway) Company of Royal
Engineers both to carry out some local works in the neighbourhood
of Suakin and to assist the contractors in the
longer undertaking; and this military element was strengthened,
not only by a force of Indian coolies, but, also, by
the addition of thirty-nine members of Engineer Volunteer
Corps in England who had enlisted for the campaign, all
having had experience in trades qualifying them for railway
work.<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> There was thus practically a dual system,
workable, in the opinion of Sir Andrew Clarke, "only by a
species of compromise which was both unscientific and
uneconomical."</p>

<p>As for interruptions by the Dervishes, these took the
form of constant attacks both on the line under construction
and on the workers. Several actions were fought,
and at Tofrik, near Suakin, the British sustained a serious
loss of life. Posts were erected as the work slowly progressed,
and the bullet-proof train mentioned on page <a href="#Page_76">76</a>
was used for patrolling the line at night; but in face of
all the difficulties experienced the work was definitely
abandoned when only twenty miles of the intended railway
had been completed. The troops were recalled in
June, 1885, the railway material not used was brought
back to England, and a line linking up Suakin (and Port
Sudan) with Berber, via Atbara Junction, was not finally
opened until 1906.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
<p>Reverting to the Nile Valley Railway, it is gratifying
to be able to say that the success already spoken of as
having been attained in this direction was but a prelude
to still more important developments that were to follow.</p>

<p>To prevent the carrying out of schemes which the Dervishes
were known to be preparing for an invasion of Egypt, the
British Government decided, early in 1896, to allow Egypt
to resume occupation of the country along the Nile Valley
abandoned at the time of the withdrawal in 1885, and on
March 12, 1896, Sir Herbert (now Earl) Kitchener, who
had succeeded to the command of the Egyptian army in
1892, received instructions to advance to the south from
Wady Halfa. Akasha, the point to which the Nile Valley
Railway had been built, was occupied on March 20, the
Dervishes retreating to Firket.</p>

<p>As a means towards realising the objects of the expedition,
Sir Herbert Kitchener resolved to continue the railway
along the Nile Valley to Kerma; but this meant the
construction of practically a new railway, since the Dervishes
had torn up over fifty of the eighty-seven miles
of the original line between Wady Halfa and Akasha,
burning the sleepers and twisting the rails, while the remainder
of the line was in such a condition that it required
relaying. The work of construction was entrusted to a
staff of Royal Engineers operating under Lieut. (now
Major-General Sir E. Percy C.) Girouard, and it was pushed
forward with great energy, the line being urgently required
for the forwarding of stores to the front, and especially
so on account of the impediments to navigation along the
Nile due to the cataracts.</p>

<p>With the help of the railway, so far as it had then been
restored, Sir Herbert Kitchener concentrated a force of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
9,000 men at Akasha, and early in June he made a successful
advance on Firket. The Dervishes retired to Dongola;
but it was thought prudent, before following them up, to
await a further extension of the railway. This was completed
as far as Kosha, 116 miles from Wady Halfa, by
August 4, 1896. Three weeks later some heavy rains,
lasting three days, were the cause of floods which, in a few
hours, destroyed twelve miles of the newly-constructed
line. The repairs were completed in about a week, but in
the same month there was an outbreak of cholera which
carried off a large number of the working staff.</p>

<p>Utilising the railway as far as Kosha, Sir Herbert Kitchener
concentrated the whole of his force at Fereig, on
the north of the Kaibar cataract, and from thence a further
advance was made to Dongola, which place the Dervishes
made no attempt to defend.</p>

<p>The immediate purpose of the expedition had thus been
attained; but, in the meantime, a further campaign had
been resolved upon for the purpose of breaking down the
power of the Khalifa and effecting the conquest of Khartoum.
To this end the railway was continued another hundred
miles, from Kosha to Kerma, which point was reached in
May, 1897. Some 216 miles of railway had thus been completed
in about thirteen months, notwithstanding interruptions
which had led to very little progress being made
during five months of this period, and notwithstanding,
also, the fact that construction work had to be carried on
simultaneously with the transport of troops and stores
so far as the line had been completed.</p>

<p>Before, however, Kerma was reached, Sir Herbert Kitchener
instructed the staff of the Royal Engineers to make
a survey of the Nubian Desert with a view to seeing whether
or not it would be practicable to build an alternative line
of railway across it from Wady Halfa direct to Abu Hamed
(a distance of 232 miles), thus giving a direct route to Khartoum.</p>

<p>A survey carried out at the end of 1896 showed that the
work was not likely to present any unsurmountable engineering
difficulties, and that the absence of water could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
be overcome by the sinking of wells. The only doubtful
point was whether construction could be carried through
without interruption by a still active enemy.</p>

<p>It was seen that the proposed desert line was likely to be
of far greater importance, both strategically and politically,
than a continuation of the Wady Halfa-Kerma line round
the remainder of the Nile bend. The cutting off of this
bend altogether would confer a great advantage on the
Expeditionary Force. It was thus resolved to build the
line, to run the risk of attacks by the enemy, and to push
construction forward with the greatest energy.</p>

<p>A start was made with the work on May 15, 1897, the
staff which had been engaged on the Nile Valley line to
Kerma returning to Wady Halfa in order to take the desert
line in hand. By the end of July, 115 of the 232 miles of
line had been completed, and Sir Herbert Kitchener,
utilising the railway which had already been constructed
to Kerma, then sent a force along the Nile Valley to effect
the capture of Abu Hamed. This was accomplished on
August 7, and the constructors of the desert line were
thus enabled to resume their work with greater security
and even accelerated speed. Abu Hamed was reached on
October 31, 1897, the two extreme points of the great Nile
bend being thus brought into communication by a direct
line of railway. The construction of the 232 miles of track
had been accomplished in five and a half months, notwithstanding
the fact that the work was carried on during
the hottest time of the year. An average length of a mile
and a quarter of line was laid per day, while on one day in
October a maximum of three and a quarter miles was
attained. So well, too, had the work been done that trains
carrying 200 tons of stores, drawn by engines weighing,
without tender, fifty tons, were taken safely across the
desert at a speed of twenty-five miles per hour.</p>

<p>From Abu Hamed the line was at once pushed on in the
direction of Berber, and its value from a military point of
view was speedily to be proved. Receiving information,
towards the end of 1897, that the Dervishes were planning
an attack on Berber, Sir Herbert Kitchener sent to Cairo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
for a Brigade of British troops to join with the Egyptian
forces then at Berber in opposing this advance, and the
Brigade arrived in January, 1898, having travelled by the
desert railway not only to Abu Hamed, but to a point
twenty miles farther south, which then constituted railhead.
Early in March the Anglo-Egyptian Army was
concentrated between Berber and the Atbara river, and
the battle of Atbara, fought in the following month, led
to the complete annihilation of the forces sent by the
Khalifa to drive the Egyptians out of Berber.</p>

<p>There was known to be still an army of 50,000 men in
Omdurman, at the command of the Khalifa; but it was
considered desirable, before any further advance was made
by the Anglo-Egyptian forces, to await not only the completion
of the railway to the Atbara but the rise, also,
of the Nile, so that the river would be available for the
bringing up of steamers and gunboats to take part in the
attack on Omdurman.</p>

<p>Once more, therefore, Lieut. Girouard and his staff had
to make the most strenuous efforts, and these were again
so successful that the line was carried to the Atbara early
in July. It was of the greatest service in facilitating the
concentration of an Anglo-Egyptian Army, 22,000 strong,
at Wad Hamed, and the victory of Omdurman, on September
2, 1898&mdash;when 20,000 of the enemy were killed or
wounded&mdash;followed by the occupation of Khartoum, meant
the overthrow of the Mahdi, the final reconquest of the
Sudan, and the gaining of a further great triumph in the
cause of civilisation.</p>

<p>In the account of these events which he gives in volume
three of the "History of the Corps of the Royal Engineers,"
Colonel Sir Charles M. Watson says concerning this ultimate
outcome of a rebellion which had lasted, altogether, for a
period of eighteen years:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lord Kitchener, of course, by the skill and determination
with which he conducted the operations to a successful termination,
deserves the principal credit for the happy conclusion
of the campaign. But it must not be forgotten that a large
part of the work was carried out by the officers of the Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>Engineers, especially those who had charge of the construction
and maintenance of that railway without which, it is fair
to say, the campaign could not have been conducted at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final triumph was the more gratifying because,
although the desert railway had contributed so materially
thereto, dependence upon it had not been without an element
of serious risk which cannot be told better than in the
words of Lord Cromer, in his book on "Modern Egypt":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The interval which elapsed between the occupation of Abu
Hamed and the final advance on Khartoum was a period of
much anxiety. Sir Herbert Kitchener's force depended entirely
on the desert railway for its supplies. I was rather haunted
with the idea that some European adventurer, of the type
familiar in India a century and more ago, might turn up at
Khartoum and advise the Dervishes to make frequent raids
across the Nile below Abu Hamed with a view to cutting the
communication of the Anglo-Egyptian force with Wady Halfa.
This was unquestionably the right military operation to have
undertaken; neither, I think, would it have been very difficult
of accomplishment. Fortunately the Dervishes ...
failed to take advantage of the opportunity presented to them.
To myself it was a great relief when the period of suspense
was over. I do not think that the somewhat perilous position
in which Sir Herbert Kitchener's army was undoubtedly placed
for some time was at all realised by the public in general.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within about two months of the battle of Omdurman
the plans were made for a further extension of the railway
from Atbara to Khartoum, and Khartoum North was
reached on the last day of 1899. The construction of a
bridge over the Blue Nile subsequently allowed of trains
running direct into Khartoum.</p>

<p>To-day this same railway has been carried a distance of
430 miles south of Khartoum. It continues along the Blue
Nile to Sennah, where it turns to the westward, crosses
the White Nile at Kosti, and has its terminus at El Obeid,
the capital of Kordofan Province. What this means is
that an enormous expanse of territory has been opened
up both to civilisation and to commercial development.</p>

<p>Apart from the important gum trade of which El Obeid
is the centre, the Sudan is pre-eminently a pastoral country.
The number of its cattle, sheep and goats is estimated at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
"several millions"; it has thousands of square miles
available for cotton-growing, already carried on there for
centuries, and it has wide possibilities in other directions,
besides; though stock-raising and cotton cultivation should
alone suffice to ensure for the Sudan a future of great
wealth and commercial importance.</p>

<p>Beyond the districts immediately served by the extension
there are others which are to be brought into touch with
the railway, either direct or via the Nile, by means of a
"roads system" linking up towns and villages with a
number of highways extending to all the frontiers of the
Sudan. On these roads and highways motor traction will,
it is hoped, be gradually substituted for transport animals,
the troubles caused by the tsetse fly and other pests
being thus avoided.</p>

<p>The scheme here in question is certainly an ambitious
one, considering that the Sudan covers an area of 1,000,000
square miles, and is equal in extent to the whole of British
India; but already the outlook is most promising. For
twelve years before its rescue from heathenism by the
British and Egyptian forces in 1898, Khartoum, which
formerly had a population of 50,000, was represented by
the mass of ruins to which it had been reduced by order of
the Khalifa. To-day it is a large, beautiful, and well-built
city, possessed of a Governor-General's palace, cathedrals,
a mosque, schools, hospitals, hotels, broad streets,
public gardens, boulevards, imposing business premises,
a good water supply, electric light, tramways, ferries, and
other essentials of a capital city of the most progressive
type. Khartoum itself has now about 30,000 inhabitants;
in Khartoum North, on the other side of the Blue Nile,
there are 20,000, and in Omdurman 70,000, a total of
120,000 for the three sister cities. Not only, also, have
the natives, once living under the terror of their oppressors,
settled down to peaceful pursuits, but many thousands of
immigrants have come into the Sudan from West Africa
(a striking testimony of the confidence felt by native
tribes in the justice and security of British rule), while
great expansion has taken place in the commercial interests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of the Sudan and more especially in the export of cattle
and sheep.</p>

<p>In the bringing about of these developments, affecting
the peace and prosperity of so huge a country and of so
many millions of people, the Sudan Military Railways
have played a leading part. They rendered possible, in
the first instance, the conquest of the Sudan, and then (save
for the now abandoned line from Wady Halfa to Kerma)
they became, with their extensions and improvements, the
system of "Sudan Government Railways," having their
branches to-day both from Atbara to Port Sudan and
Suakin, on the Red Sea, and from Abu Hamed to Kareima,
on the south side of the great Nile bend, whence there is
free communication by water to the third cataract at
Kerma. Concurrently, also, with the carrying out of the
railway extension schemes, and in order to make greater
provision for the prospective increase of traffic, 460 miles
of the line north of Khartoum were relaid with 75-lb. rails,
in place of the 50-lb. rails originally used, and the whole
of the track from Khartoum to El Obeid was also laid with
the heavier rails.</p>

<p>So we are enabled to regard military railways from still
another point of view&mdash;that, namely, in which they may
develop into lines of permanent communication and promote
the blessings of peace and security no less than afford
unquestionable advantages in the prosecution of war.
Other examples of a similar kind might be offered from the
history of British rule in Africa; but the record of what
has been accomplished in the Sudan may suffice to establish
the further claim here presented as to the varied purposes
that military railways may serve.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="smcap">Railways in the Boer War</span></h2>


<p>The South African campaign of 1899-1902 afforded to
Great Britain and to British Imperial interests their greatest,
most instructive, and, also, their most anxious experiences,
down to that time, not only of the services railways can
render in the conduct of war, but of the difficulties and
complications which may result from their employment,
and especially from dependence on them for the purposes
of military transport; though, in the result, the services
so rendered were a material factor in the success by which
the military operations carried out by the British forces
were crowned.</p>

<p>When the Boers declared war in October, 1899, the various
railway systems, working in direct communication
with one another, in South Africa, had a total length of
4,268 miles, namely, British South Africa, 3,267; the
Transvaal, 918; the Orange Free State, 388; and in Portuguese
territory, 55. These railways consisted of single-track,
narrow-gauge lines (3 feet 6 inches), never designed for
such heavy traffic as the transport of an army and all its
impedimenta would involve; but it was obvious from the
first that they must needs play a part of paramount importance
in the campaign. Independently of all that was
involved in the conveyance of troops, munitions, supplies,
etc., from England to the Cape, there was the consideration
that from Cape Town, the principal base of our forces,
to Pretoria, their eventual objective, the distance was
1,040 miles. From Port Elizabeth it was 740 miles, and
from Durban 511 miles. Journeys such as these could be
made only by rail, and there was seen to be an imperative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
need, not only for the railways themselves, but for an
organisation which would, among other things, superintend
military rail-transport in order to ensure efficiency in the
movement of troops, stores, etc., and, also, provide for the
speedy repair or rebuilding of damaged lines as well as for
the operation of lines taken possession of in the captured
territory.</p>

<p>In view of the uncertainty of events in the Transvaal,
and as a precautionary measure, the 8th (Railway) Company,
Royal Engineers, was sent out to the Cape in July,
1899; and when, subsequently, the dispatch of an Army
Corps was being arranged by the British Government, it was
decided to create a <i>Department of Military Railways</i>, of
which Major Girouard, R.E. (now Major-General Sir E.
Percy C. Girouard, K.C.M.G.), who had rendered such
valuable services in connection with military railways in
the Sudan, and was then President of the Egyptian Railway
Administration, was put in charge as "Director of
Railways for the South African Field Force." A number
of other Royal Engineer officers who had had experience
of railway work in India and other parts of the British
Empire were selected to serve as Assistant Directors or
staff officers in various capacities, and the 10th (Railway)
Company, Royal Engineers, with the 6th, 20th, 31st and
42nd Fortress Companies, were sent to join the 8th (Railway)
Company in the carrying out of railway work.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Organisation and Control</span></h3>

<p>The creation of this Department of Military Railways
for South Africa carried still further the development of
those questions of organisation and control which, as we
have seen, had already raised important issues in the United
States, in Germany, and in France.</p>

<p>According to the official "History of the War in South
Africa, 1899-1902," the Director and his staff were (1) to
be the intermediaries between the Army and the technical
working administration of the railway; (2) to see that the
ordinary working of the railway was carried on in such a
manner as to ensure the greatest military efficiency; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
(3) to satisfy the demands of the Army on the railway
without disorganising the working of the railway system
as a whole.</p>

<p>"In war," the official "History" further declares,
"these services are essential, for the officers of a civil
railway administration cannot discriminate between the
demands of the various branches and departments of the
Army, or class them in the order of urgency." This is
perfectly true of the civil railway administration, and it
is only what could be expected of railwaymen who, while
competent to discharge their ordinary railway duties,
might not be well versed in military matters, and ought
not to be left with the responsibility of deciding between
the possibly conflicting orders of different military commanders.</p>

<p>All the same, there was another side to the question;
and this is dealt with by Sir Percy Girouard in his "History
of the Railways during the War in South Africa," wherein
he says, in regard to rail transport conditions in time of
war:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Military commanders who have not previously studied the
working of a railway attempt to seize and work the portion
of line nearest to them, regardless of the remainder of the system.
They often look upon trucks as another form of commissariat
wagon which may be kept loaded for an indefinite period. They
expect trains to stop and off-load, or load, on the main line.
They like to have a number of trains ready, either loaded or
unloaded, in case they should be required. They are apt to
give orders for large entrainments and detrainments to be
carried out at any part of the line, regardless of the railway
facilities at that point, although perhaps a suitable place is
within reasonable distance. Frequently they have been known
to countermand their orders for entrainments, heedless of the
fact that, once arrangements have been made to concentrate
rolling stock on a certain place, it takes time to alter these
arrangements, and is sure to cause confusion. Many of them
expect railway accommodation for troops to be on a liberal
scale, and consider that there is no necessity, when close to a
railway, to make any effort to cut down baggage and stores....</p>

<p>Commandants of posts on the line, which are very often
placed at railway stations, are inclined to think that, because
they are called "station commandants," it means that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
are in charge of the railway station, and can give orders to
railway officials as to traffic and other matters....</p>

<p>Civil railway officials have been heard to say that attacks
by the enemy are not nearly so disturbing to traffic as the
arrival of a friendly General with his force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was under these circumstances that Sir Percy Girouard
saw from the first the necessity for having in South Africa,
for the duration of the war, a staff of officers whose business
it would be, as he himself defines their duties, (<i>a</i>) to keep
the military commanders fully informed of the capacity
and possibilities of the railway, and to convey their orders
and requests to the civil railway staff; and (<i>b</i>) to protect
the civil railway administration from interference by military
commanders and commandants of posts; in fact, to
act as intermediaries between the army and the civil railway
officials.</p>

<p>In arriving at this conclusion Sir Percy was especially
impressed by the rail transport experiences of France in her
war with Prussia in 1870-1; and in his Report he gives a
digest of Jacqmin's facts and recommendations by way of
further justifying the step that he himself took. He thought
it absolutely necessary that the staff of the Director
of Railways should be paramount on the railway, and
that no officer should be able to give any orders to railway
staff officers or other railway officials unless fighting was
actually proceeding at that spot. "This," he adds, "was
the system adopted with great success by the Germans,
the want of which caused such chaos on the French railways,
and the correctness of which has been entirely established
by the experience of this war. It is not too much to say
that, unless it had been adopted in South Africa, the chaos
would have been past belief."</p>

<p>The <i>Military Railway Controlling-Staff</i> created, in accordance
with these principles and policy, to co-operate with the
technical working staff under the Director of Railways,
was constituted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. An <i>Assistant-Director of Railways</i> for Cape Colony,
who was on the staff both of the Director of Railways and
on that of the General Officer Commanding Lines of Communication,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Cape Colony. His business it was to co-operate
with the General Traffic Manager of the Cape Government
Railway, in whose office he was given accommodation. In
this dual capacity it was his duty to inform both the General
Officer Commanding and the Director as to the traffic
capacities of the railways; to take the orders of the G.O.C.
while advising him as to the best method of carrying them
out; to inform the railway officials what was required, and,
Sir Percy adds, in giving these details, "to protect them
from interference by unauthorised military officers." It
was the duty, also, of the Assistant-Director to see that
proper regulations were issued to the Army for (<i>a</i>) the
efficient conduct of entrainments and detrainments; (<i>b</i>)
the forwarding of stores, and (<i>c</i>) the keeping of financial
accounts in respect to the use made of the lines for military
purposes. As between the General Officer Commanding
and the Chief Traffic Manager, the Assistant-Director of
Railways was the sole channel of communication.</p>

<p>II. Four <i>Deputy-Assistant-Directors</i>, undertaking similar
duties over particular sections of the railway system.</p>

<p>III. <i>Railway Staff Officers</i>, located at leading stations to
superintend all important movements, and constituting
the only means of communication between the Army and
the stationmasters. The latter were to take orders in
respect to military requirements from no one else, and were,
in turn, to be protected by the railway staff officers from
interference with by other officers having no authority to
give them direct orders.</p>

<p>The defective step in the scheme, as originally planned,
was in respect to the railway staff officers, who, of all those
constituting the Military Railway Controlling Staff, were,
under Army Regulations, on the staff of officers commanding
lines of communication and thus not controlled by the
Director of Railways. The officers in question, though
charged with the duty of looking after entrainments, detrainments,
etc., were in no way to interfere with the railway
staff in the shunting or marshalling of trains or in regard to
the traffic arrangements generally. For this reason the
framers of the Army Regulations had assumed that there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
was no need for the railway staff officers to have any knowledge
of railway operation, or to be under the control of
others who did possess such knowledge.</p>

<p>After the annexation of the Orange Free State railways,
the Chief of the Staff agreed that the railway staff officers
in that State should be under the orders of the Director
of Railways through his Deputy-Assistant-Directors; and
a like course was adopted shortly afterwards in respect
to the railway staff officers in Cape Colony. In this way
an undivided chain of responsibility was secured, affording
a much greater guarantee of efficiency alike in control and
in actual operation.</p>

<p>Concerning the Deputy-Assistant-Directors, Sir Percy
Girouard says they were found to be of great benefit to the
railway officials, who appreciated their work and laboured
in hearty co-operation with them; though they experienced
difficulty in establishing their position with the Generals
and Staff officers, to whom the arrangement was an entire
novelty, and one they did not at first understand.</p>

<p>In the first instance the principle of military control
applied specially to the lines in Cape Colony, those in Natal
being still operated by the Natal Government Railway
Department, with certain assistance in the matter of repairs;
though after eighteen months of war, the military
transport system first established in Cape Colony became
uniform throughout British South Africa.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Transport Conditions</span></h3>

<p>The need for the elaborate organisation thus brought
into existence was all the greater because of the difficulties
by which those responsible for the conduct of military
transport were faced.</p>

<p>In November, 1899, considerable portions of the lines
both in Cape Colony and in Natal were in the possession of
the Boers, so that, beyond a certain distance, the British
would have to fight for every mile of railway before they
could make use of it. After, also, regaining possession of
the lines on British territory controlled by the Boers, they
would require first to capture and then to operate those on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the enemy's territory; and in each case they would have
to be prepared to repair the damage the enemy would be
certain to do to the lines in order to prevent their use by
the advancing forces. Meanwhile the traffic must be kept
open, as far as possible, for the conveyance of troops and
stores to the theatre of war and for the carrying out of such
strategic movements as the requirements of the military
situation might render necessary, adequate protection of
the lines being meanwhile assured. There were, in fact,
occasions when the whole issue of the campaign seemed to
turn upon the question as to whether or not the British
could either secure possession of the railways or, alternatively,
repair them as fast, more or less, as the enemy could
demolish them.</p>

<p>Although, again, so elaborate a system of organisation had
been arranged, there was much that required to be done to
adapt it to the conditions of African warfare. Initial mistakes
had to be remedied; old evils reappeared in new
forms; regulations had to be made or modified according
to experiences gained; and, while there was at no time any
general failure of transport, there certainly were partial
failures. Not only was there an inadequate supply of
trucks, partly because of the considerable number in the
Boer States at the time of the declaration of war and partly
because of the number locked up in Kimberley and Mafeking,
but trucks were kept loaded when they should have
been promptly unloaded and released for service elsewhere;
lines were seriously blocked at critical moments by these
loaded trucks, while chaos in certain large troop movements
was only avoided owing to the control of Cape Town facilities
by the Director's staff and to the fact that the Deputy-Assistant-Directors
of Railways were enabled to have special
officers at all important points.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">How the System Worked</span></h3>

<p>As regards the <i>operation of the railways</i> during the war
Sir Percy Girouard says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Although not, perhaps, so much a matter of railway as of
general staff administration, a word should be said as to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
methods whereby the very limited resources of the single line
of railway communication were allotted to ensure an equal
attention to the requirements of the Army as a whole.</p>

<p>The allocation of railway facilities was reserved strictly to
the Chief of Staff, without whose order, in each case, nothing
could pass by rail towards the front. The number of trains,
or, more accurately, the number of trucks which could be hauled
daily in the "up" direction, being communicated by the railway
authorities to Lord Kitchener, he placed a number, liable
to vary from day to day, at the disposal of the supply and
remount departments, either generally for the maintenance
of their depôts or for specific traffic.</p>

<p>The number reserved for hospital, ordnance, engineer and
special stores was even more closely calculated, and the demands
of these departments had to be submitted for approval in the
utmost detail. All authorisations were passed to the railway
representatives at Headquarters, whose business it was to notify
when the total of such orders outstanding for dispatch from
the advanced base was exceeding the accommodation which
could be provided within a reasonable time under the scheme
of proportion in force for the time being. In such case the
issue of permits fell temporarily into abeyance, or the outstanding
list was revised to accord with the necessities of the moment.
No truck could be loaded and no troops dispatched by rail
without such authority, with the single exception of details
and small parties, who were invariably made to travel upon the
loaded supply trucks. Proposed troop movements by rail
requiring separate accommodation had to be carefully considered
in view of the supply traffic they would displace, and,
when time permitted, were generally made by road. It was
this system alone which co-ordinated the railway requirements
of the various departments and did so much to falsify previously
accepted figures as to the limits of the fighting force
which could be maintained by a single line of railway.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Imperial Military Railways</span></h3>

<p>Following the questions which arose as to the working of
railways on British territory within the sphere of the military
operations came those concerning the <i>railways taken from
the enemy</i> in the Boer States, and converted into a system
of Imperial Military Railways for which the Department
also became responsible.</p>

<p>The occupation of Bloemfontein led to that place becoming
the base of supplies for an army of 35,000 men, likely to
increase to 100,000, while eventually the Imperial Military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Railways included 1,130 miles of line. Efficient operation
thus became a matter of grave importance, and the task
to be accomplished was one of considerable magnitude,
especially considering that a staff for the working of the
system had to be created. In the traffic and locomotive
departments alone no fewer than 3,000 white workers were
needed.</p>

<p>Many of the employés of the Netherlands Railway Company
were kept on, even at the risk of their showing hostility
to the British; but the number who thus made themselves
available was quite inadequate, even if they could all
have been trusted. The Cape Government Railways were
drawn on to the fullest possible extent for workers; the
Railway and the Fortress Companies of the Royal Engineers
in South Africa were employed in operating the lines; railwaymen
in the Special Railway Reserve in England were
sent for, and, of the remaining posts, from 800 to 1,000 were
filled&mdash;the approval of the Commander-in-Chief being first
obtained&mdash;by inviting soldiers and reservists serving in the
Army who had had experience of railway work in civil
life to join the staff of the Imperial Military Railways, pay
at Royal Engineer rates being guaranteed to them. Positions
of the least importance were filled by men who had
had no previous railway experience at all. Railway staff
officers were also obtained mainly from among the troops;
though many even of these, being unfamiliar with the details
of railway operation, had to be taught their special duties
before they could attempt to discharge them.</p>

<p>On September 30, 1900, the staff employed on the Imperial
Military Railways comprised close on 18,000 officers
and men. From the time these railways were brought
under the control of the British forces to August 31, 1900,
they carried 177,000 passengers, 86,000 animals, and 520,000
tons of goods.</p>

<p>As the moral to be drawn from his experiences in
having to create, under circumstances of exceptional difficulty,
a staff for the operation of railways captured from the
enemy, Sir Percy Girouard says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The South African campaign has fully shown the necessity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>of having a number of traffic employés registered in peace
time, who are paid a small retaining fee which will render them
liable to be called out in case of war at home or abroad. The
want of this system forced the Director of Railways in South
Africa to employ a large number of men who had been employed
by the enemy, and who could not be relied on, and also to withdraw
from the fighting-line a large number of soldiers with railway
experience prior to enlistment; and he was compelled to
work the railways with this heterogeneous mass of individuals
whose qualifications were unknown. The amount of correspondence
entailed over conditions of service, pay, transfer,
etc., of all these men, coming from different parts of South
Africa and from different units, was tremendous. The registration
system would also arrange for the men on the railways
being subject to Military Law, the necessity for which has been
clearly proved.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Repair of Railways</span></h3>

<p>Whilst all these arrangements in regard to operation and
transport were thus being perfected, the need had arisen
for an equally complete organisation in another direction,
that, namely, of providing for the <i>repair or restoration of
railway lines</i> damaged or destroyed by the enemy.</p>

<p>Since the American Civil War the art of railway demolition
had made considerable advance by reason of the use
for this purpose of dynamite&mdash;an agency which was now
to be employed very freely by the Boers. With dynamite
they easily blew up the bridges, or material portions thereof;
they destroyed the track for considerable distances by the
simple process of exploding dynamite cartridges under
alternate rail-joints; they wrecked culverts, pumps and
water tanks, and they effectively damaged locomotives
which they had not time or opportunity to remove. Then,
among other things, they derailed engines and trucks by
means of mines; they caused obstructions by throwing
down into the railway cuttings boulders of up to two or
three tons in weight; they cut telegraph lines; they removed
or smashed up instruments and batteries at railway
stations; they wrecked the stations; they burned many
railway trucks, or otherwise rendered them useless; they
set fire to stacks of fuel, and, when dynamite cartridges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
were not available, they deprived the locomotives of their
vital parts and tore up considerable lengths of rails.</p>

<p>By December, 1899, it had become evident that the
Railway Companies and the Fortress Companies of the
Royal Engineers, sent out to the Cape and brought up to
their fullest strength, would be unequal to the requirements
of the prospective situation. The Railway Corps thus
formed was, accordingly, augmented by a Railway Pioneer
Regiment, composed of miners, artisans and labourers who
had been employed at Cape Town or Johannesburg, volunteers
from the ranks of the Army (preference being given
to those already possessed of experience in railway work),
and employés of the Orange Free State Railway. Some
Field Railway Sections, created to form the nucleus of a
staff to take over the working of railways in the enemy's
country became construction parties, doing repairs only,
and having no control of traffic except at railhead. In
addition to all these, a large number of natives were engaged
through Native Labour Depôts opened at De Aar, Bloemfontein
and Johannesburg, the number so employed at any
one time attaining a maximum of about 20,000.</p>

<p>It was in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal that
the Boers displayed their greatest activity in the way of
railway destruction. At Norval's Pont and Bethulie they
broke down the bridges crossing the Orange River, which
divided Cape Colony from the Orange Free State. Before
leaving Bloemfontein (occupied by the British March 13,
1900), they destroyed all the bridges and all the culverts on
the railway in their rear; they blew up miles of the permanent
way, and they left the railway itself an almost
complete wreck. North of Bloemfontein they pursued
similar tactics along 180 miles of track, on which they
wrecked more or less completely no fewer than fifty bridges,
including the one over the Vaal River&mdash;a high structure with
seven spans each of 130 feet. No sooner, too, had the line
been reopened as far as Johannesburg than Commandant
De Wet made a raid on it and undid all that the repairing
parties had done over a length of thirty miles. Speedily
following the re-establishing of rail communication with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Pretoria, the Boers began a fresh series of guerilla attacks
on the lines both in the Transvaal and in the Orange Free
State; and they continued these attacks for months&mdash;until,
in fact, their power for doing further mischief had
been finally checked.</p>

<p>In carrying out repairs and reconstruction work of such
vital importance to the advance and security of the British
forces, the policy adopted by the Director of Railways was
that of employing Royal Engineers to do rapid temporary
repairs&mdash;with a view to having a line of some sort made
available with the least possible delay&mdash;and leaving permanent
or even semi-permanent repairs to the Railway
Pioneer Regiment. At convenient sidings on the railways
throughout the theatre of war <i>construction trains</i> were
stationed in charge of permanent-way inspectors and sections
of Royal Engineers who had at their disposal, at each
of such sidings, a gang of men&mdash;whites and natives&mdash;varying
in number from 300 to 1,000, according to circumstances.
Infantry working-parties were also obtained wherever
possible.</p>

<p>Gangers began a patrol of the lines at dawn. Information
as to any break or alarm was communicated to the
nearest military post and telegraphed to the Deputy-Superintendent
of Works, who thereupon ordered the dispatch
of a construction train to the scene of any reported or prospective
break without waiting for confirmation of the news
received or of the suspicions aroused.</p>

<p>This well-organised system operated to great advantage.
At 2.30 a.m. on January 1, 1901, for instance, information
reached the Deputy-Superintendent of Works at Bloemfontein
that a break of the line had occurred at Wolvehoek,
sixty-three miles distant. The construction train was
instantly dispatched, and the repairs were completed by
8 a.m. Rail communication with Johannesburg, notwithstanding
the great amount of destruction done by the Boers,
was restored within eleven days of the arrival of Lord
Roberts at that place. It was restored to Pretoria within
sixteen days of the occupation thereof by our troops. On
the western side, where the enemy had been no less active<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
than in the Orange Free State, rail communication was
reopened within thirteen days of the relief of Mafeking.</p>

<p>In the official report on Field Transport in the South
African War, it is said in regard to the Railways Department:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All temporary repairs in the Cape Colony, Transvaal, and
Orange River Colony were carried out, with a few exceptions,
by the military railway staff. Up to 31 October, 1900, these
temporary repairs included the restoration of seventy-five
bridges, ninety-four culverts, and 37 miles of line. A detail of
the general advance from Bloemfontein to Johannesburg, a
distance of 265 miles, will give some idea of the expedition with
which repairs were affected. The period during which the
advance was being made was from 3 May to 11 June, 1900, in
which space of time the following temporary repairs were executed:
Twenty-seven bridges, forty-one culverts, 10 miles of
line, including seven deviations, varying in length from 200
yards to 2 miles.</p>

<p>From 6 June to 15 November, 1900, the Imperial Military
Railways were more or less seriously damaged by the enemy
on 115 occasions, but all such damages were promptly repaired,
and did not materially affect the working of the railways, except
that the running of trains after dark had to be suspended. During
the same period fully 60 per cent. of damaged bridges and
culverts were permanently or semi-permanently repaired.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of <i>bridges</i>, over 200, with spans ranging from nine feet
to 130 feet, were destroyed wholly or in part during the
progress of the war; but even here the speedy restoration
of traffic did not, as a rule, present any very grave difficulty.
The course generally adopted, as one suited to South African
conditions, was, not to start at once on the repair of the
damaged bridge, but, in order to meet the exigencies of the
moment, to construct a diversion or deviation line alongside,
with small low-level bridges on piers, built of sleepers
and rails.<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> These deviation lines offered great disadvantages
by reason of their sharp curves, their steep approaches
and their liability to be washed away in wet weather. The
building even of temporary bridges across deep rivers having
a considerable volume of water also caused inevitable delays.
But the lines in question served their purpose until the
reconstruction of the damaged bridges&mdash;taken in hand as
speedily as possible&mdash;could be effected. Anticipating the
needs for this more permanent work, the Director of Railways
had arranged before leaving England for a supply of
girders, similar to those in use in South Africa, to be sent
out, together with sufficient timber, of useful dimensions,
to rebuild the whole of the railway bridges in the Orange
Free State, should it become necessary so to do&mdash;as, in
point of fact, it did. Of new rails he had available, at one
time, a total length of 300 miles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p>By October, 1900, the makeshift repairs completed on all
the lines taken from the enemy were being gradually converted
into permanent or semi-permanent reconstruction
by the Works Department of the Imperial Military Railways;
but the continuous guerilla raids of the enemy still
made it impossible to run trains by night. These conditions
led to a resort to the system of <i>blockhouses</i> which, first
constructed for the defence of railway bridges in Natal
during the advance for the relief of Ladysmith, and used
extensively when Lord Roberts marched from Bloemfontein
into the Transvaal, leaving a long track of railway
lines behind him, were subsequently so far extended
that the whole of the railway lines in the Transvaal and the
Orange River Colony were provided with them.<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> So well
did they answer the purpose that by April, 1901, the worst
of the trouble involved in maintaining railway communications
was over, although another year was to elapse before
peace was restored.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Military Traffic</span></h3>

<p>An especially remarkable achievement with which, under
the various conditions here narrated, the Department of
Military Railways is to be credited was in connection with
the concentration of the force with which Lord Roberts
marched from the Modder River to Bloemfontein. The
movement began on January 21, 1900, by which time the
repairs of the lines had been completed, and within three
weeks no fewer than 20,000 men, 13,590 horses and over
24,000 tons of stores had been conveyed over a single line
of railway.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p>Taking the sum total of the military traffic carried on the
Cape Government and the Natal Government Railways
respectively during the war period, we get the following
substantial figures:&mdash;</p>

<p>Cape Government Railways, from October 1, 1899, to
March 31, 1901:&mdash;Officers, men, and other passengers,
1,247,000; supplies, etc., 1,058,000 tons; horses and other
live stock, 540,321, besides many wagons and guns.</p>

<p>Natal Government Railways:&mdash;Officers, men, prisoners
of war, sick and wounded, women and children (including
Boer refugees), natives and Indians, 522,186; baggage and
stores, supplies, hay, forage, etc., 861,000 tons; ammunition,
9,784 boxes; guns, 454; vehicles, 6,430; pontoons,
48; traction engines, 84; horses and other live stock,
399,000.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Miscellaneous Services</span></h3>

<p>The figures here given as to the military traffic carried
do not represent the full extent of the work that was done
by the South African railways during the course of the war.
One must also take into account the wide variety of subsidiary
services rendered, and these are the more deserving
of attention because they show, more than had, perhaps,
been the case in any previous war, that railways can afford
valuable aid in the conduct of a campaign apart from the
achievement of their fundamental purpose in the transport
of men and matériel.</p>

<p>If we look at the list of services rendered by the Natal
Government Railways we find that the Railway Department&mdash;in
addition to the transport work represented by the
above figures&mdash;adapted six armoured trains; prepared
special carriages for the 6 in. and 4·7 in. guns; adapted and
equipped three hospital trains, withdrawing for this purpose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
fully a quarter of the most serviceable carriage stock from
the ordinary traffic; wired and lamped the hospitals at four
different centres, supplying them, also, with electric current;
mounted the electric search-light apparatus with
engine, dynamo, etc.; supplied 30,000 troops at Colenso
with water; found the plant and fuel at Ladysmith for
condensing water from the Klip River for 20,000 persons
during the four months' siege; allotted and arranged a
portion of the goods-shed as the Base Medical Stores at
Durban, and fitted up vans to follow the army with reserve
medical supplies.</p>

<p>The Department's Engineering Staff speedily restored,
or temporarily provided&mdash;either on the Natal system or
along 100 miles of the Transvaal railways, when these
passed under control of the British forces&mdash;72 bridges and
culverts, varying in length from 10 to 600 feet; 32 different
portions of permanent way; and many water tanks, etc.
The Engineering Staff also effected in seven days a clearance
through the Lang's Nek Tunnel, blown in by the
Boers, and constructed several miles of new lines, sidings
and deviations.</p>

<p>The Natal Railway Pioneer Staff advanced with General
Buller and worked the Netherlands Railway as far as
Greylingstad, 100 miles beyond Charlestown (the point
of traffic exchange with the Transvaal system), until the
line was taken over by the Imperial authorities on August
15, 1900.</p>

<p>"For nearly six months, up to the relief of Ladysmith,"
says Mr. C. W. Francis Harrison, from whose official work
on "Natal"<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> these details are mainly taken, "the Natal
lines were robbed of about 40 per cent. of their total mileage
and a quantity of their stock. On the clearance of the
enemy from Natal and the south-eastern portion of the
Transvaal, large supply depôts were formed at Newcastle,
Volksrust, Standerton and intermediate points; and on
the joining of the two main portions of the British army at
Heidelberg, the greater portion of the stores for the forces
was conveyed via Natal; and this continued unceasingly
until the termination of hostilities."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Armoured Trains</span></h3>

<p>It was, again, in the South African war that armoured
trains underwent their greatest development&mdash;down to
that time&mdash;for the purposes alike of line protection and of
attack on the enemy, although their real usefulness and the
conditions necessary to their efficient operation were not
established until after certain early experiences which had
tended to throw doubts upon their efficiency, and had even
led to their being regarded as of little or no account for the
purposes of war.</p>

<p>In view of prospective requirements, five armoured
trains had been constructed in advance in the locomotive
shops at Cape Town and another at Natal. Others were
put together shortly afterwards; but one of the Cape trains
was wrecked by the Boers the first night of the war, and
two of the Natal trains were locked up in Ladysmith. The
remainder were employed on scouting expeditions during
the earlier phases of the war. Their use not being then
rightly understood, they were often sent considerable distances
without any support, with the result that one of
the Natal trains was destroyed by the Boers at Chieveley,
on November 15, 1899, and the Cape trains had several
narrow escapes of sharing the same fate.</p>

<p>On the occupation of Bloemfontein by the British, more
armoured trains were constructed at the railway workshops
there, and eventually the number available was increased
to a fleet of twenty. Under an improved system of control
and operation, and converted, by the addition of guns, into
what were virtually batteries on wheels, the trains came
to be regarded as offering possibilities of much practical
usefulness.</p>

<p>In a lecture on "Railways in War," delivered by him at
the Royal Engineers' Institute, Chatham, and reported in
the "Royal Engineers Journal" for July, 1905, Sir Percy
Girouard, said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The South African War at one time threatened to produce
a siege, that of Pretoria, where fairly modern forts with modern
armaments were known to exist. At the same time the enemy
at Modder River were giving us some trouble with their heavy
artillery. The Navy came to our rescue with heavy B.L. guns
mounted on wheels. With a view to trying the use of the railway
itself, it was pointed out that the railway department had
both the shops and the goodwill to mount heavy guns, if required.
This offer was approved, and in a few weeks the two
heaviest siege guns ever seen in the field were made ready.
The carriages, designed by the combined wit of the machinery
officers and the Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the Cape
Government Railway, were most creditable achievements, old
engine and tender frames being used as a foundation. The
guns mounted were a 6-inch B.L., and no less a monster than
a 9·2 inch B.L. The 6-inch went into action at Modder River.
It was deemed unsafe to fix it at an angle of more than sixteen
degrees to either side of the centre line of the railway; but by
placing it on a so-called firing curve a wider field of fire was
secured. The gun behaved exceedingly well in every way;
and later on it was fired at right angles to the railway, without
any damage either to itself or to the line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 9·2-inch gun gave good results in its trials, but,
although it was run up to Pretoria on its truck, there was
no opportunity of firing it on the enemy.</p>

<p>Sir Percy says in his "History" that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The experiments demonstrated the possibility of big guns
being used in siege operations without any difficulty, the only
limit to the size of the gun being the weight which the railway
bridges will stand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from the powers of usefulness offered by these
batteries on wheels, there arose, in the early days of the war,
the further question whether the usefulness of armoured
trains proper might not be marred as the result of a defective
system of control.</p>

<p>At the outset the trains were placed entirely under the
orders of officers commanding sections of the line; but the
arrangement was found unsatisfactory as the trains were
constantly being rushed out regardless of Traffic Department
regulations, and sometimes without even a "line
clear" message. Having, also, the trains at their disposal,
as they considered officers commanding sections of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
line often made use of them to inspect posts between stations,
other traffic being stopped while the inspections were being
made. On one occasion, when a large mob of cattle was
being sent to Pretoria and there were no mounted troops
available to convoy them, the expedient was resorted to
of employing an armoured train for the purpose. The train
had to adapt its speed to the rate of progress of the cattle
alongside, and such was the interference with other traffic
that the entire length of railway on the Delagoa main line
was blocked until the cattle had reached their destination.
In fact, instead of assisting traffic by preventing the enemy
from interrupting it, the armoured trains caused, Sir Percy
Girouard declares, "more interruptions than the enemy
themselves."</p>

<p>With a view both to meet these particular difficulties
and to ensure a better use of the trains, there was appointed
an Assistant-Director of Armoured Trains who was placed
on the staff both of the Commander-in-Chief and of the
Director of Railways and had under his control all the
armoured trains in South Africa. Captain H. C. Nanton,
R.E., the officer so appointed, had practical acquaintance
alike with railway requirements and regulations and with
armoured trains. In touch with Headquarters, and kept
informed as to which portions of the line were most threatened
by the enemy, it became his duty to order where the
trains should be sent. Once despatched to a particular
section of the line, an armoured train was to be under the
control of the General or other officer commanding that
section. The Assistant-Director had power to remove it,
however, if he thought it was more urgently required elsewhere.
It was his duty, also, to work in harmony with the
officers in question; but they, in turn, were not to use as
a private conveyance the train sent to them, and they were
not to alter its garrison or equipment, or to give orders to
the officer in charge which were contrary to the spirit of
the general instructions. The Assistant-Director was himself
required to instruct officers in command of the trains
as to the proper tactics to adopt, the best methods of patrolling,
etc., and to see that they "worked in harmony with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the railway officials, and were an assistance and not a
hindrance to traffic."</p>

<p>These improved conditions led to a recognised system
for the employment of armoured trains, the purposes and
duties of which were eventually defined as follows<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. In conjunction with columns in the field, to intercept
the enemy whom the columns were driving on to the line.</p>

<p>2. To act on the flank of a column or line of columns, the
train being well advanced so as to prevent the enemy
breaking to that flank.</p>

<p>3. To reinforce stations and camps on the railway which
were threatened by the enemy.</p>

<p>4. To escort ordinary traffic trains.</p>

<p>5. To reconnoitre.</p>

<p>6. To patrol by day and night.</p>

<p>7. To protect traffic routes generally.</p>

<p>The garrison of an armoured train consisted of an Infantry
escort and Royal Artillery and Royal Engineer
detachments. The R.E. detachment consisted of one N.C.O.
and six sappers skilled in railway repairing work and in
re-setting derailed engines and trucks; two telegraph
linesmen; one telegraph clerk; two engine-drivers and
two firemen. When the train was engaged, all counted as
effective rifles with the exception of the driver and firemen
on the footplate, and even they carried rifles in their
engine cab for use against an enemy endeavouring to gain
possession of the engine.</p>

<p>Responsibility for the efficiency of the garrisons was
placed upon the Assistant-Director of Armoured Trains.
Whenever, also, a concentration of the trains had been
decided upon, he was to attach himself to one of them, and
take charge of the concerted action of the whole.</p>

<p>In reference to the operation of the trains Captain M.
H. Grant writes<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>:&mdash;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>It was important that the officer commanding the train
should be a man of judgment and strong nerve. He was often
called upon to act on his own responsibility. His strong armament
and defences enabled him to attack superior forces. Yet
his vulnerable points were many. He had ever to be alert
that the enemy did not cut the line behind him. In addition
to his visible foes and the constant risks of traffic in war time,
he had to contend with skilfully-used automatic and observation
mines, and had to keep his head even amid the roar which
followed the passage of his leading truck over a charge of dynamite,
and then to deal with the attack which almost certainly
ensued. Officers, therefore, had to be chosen from men of no
common stamp. The danger from contact mines was to a certain
extent obviated by a standing order that each train should
propel a heavily-loaded bogie truck. Such trucks had low
sides and ends; they in no way obstructed the view, or fire,
from the trains; and they performed the double purpose of
exploding contact mines and carrying the railway and telegraph
materials. The necessity for this propelled unoccupied bogie
was exemplified on several occasions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As regards their protection of the railway lines, the
armoured trains rendered an invaluable service, and this
was especially the case when the blockhouse system had
been fully developed, and when, concurrently therewith,
the enemy's artillery became scarce. In recording this
opinion, Sir Percy Girouard further observes:&mdash;"There is
no doubt, also, that the enemy disliked them intensely,
and the presence of an armoured train had a great moral
effect."</p>

<p>In addition to the organisation and running of these
armoured trains, there was included in every ordinary train,
as far as possible, a special gun-truck on which was a pedestal-mounted
Q. F. gun, under the charge of an escort. The
trains also carried a machine gun at each end, arranged
with a lateral sweep, to allow the fires to cross on either side
of the train at a distance of from fifty to eighty yards. In
addition to this, armour plates were hung on each side of
the driver's cab, and the first train run each morning had
two or three trucks in front of the engine as a precaution
against any mine that might have been laid over-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ambulance and Hospital Trains</span></h3>

<p>Supplementing the references already made on pp. <a href="#Page_95">95</a>-<a href="#Page_96">6</a>
to the employment of ambulance and hospital trains in the
South African War, it may here be stated that three out of
the seven adapted from rolling stock already in use on the
Cape or the Natal Government lines had been prepared in
advance of the outbreak of hostilities, namely, two at the
Cape and one in Natal, and these three were, consequently,
available for immediate use.</p>

<p>"In Cape Colony," as stated in "<i>The Times</i> History of
the War in South Africa," "the two hospital trains that
had been prepared in September were manned by a complete
<i>personnel</i> from England, and were kept in constant
touch with Lord Methuen's advance. In most cases they
were run up almost into the firing line, and during the
actions at Belmont, Graspan, Modder River and Magersfontein,
they relieved the force of its sick and wounded in
an incredibly short time, conveying some to De Aar and
Orange River, and others to the general hospitals at Cape
Town." The services thus rendered by the hospital trains
were greatly facilitated by the fact that during the first
three months of the war the fighting was almost entirely
on or alongside the railways. It was, therefore, possible
to arrange for a speedy evacuation of wounded from the
field hospitals.</p>

<p>The same two trains, after working along the line of
communication in Cape Colony, reached Bloemfontein
early in April, 1900; and here they were of great use in
helping to remove the sufferers from the enteric fever which
was filling up, not only all the hospitals, but every other
available building, as well, and finally attained, by the end
of May, a maximum of 4,000 cases. Unable to meet all
requirements arising under these exceptional conditions,
the two hospital trains were supplemented by a number of
locally-prepared or ordinary trains, made available for the
transport either of sick or of convalescents.</p>

<p>In regard to Natal, "<i>The Times</i> History" says that of all
the medical arrangements made in connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
war, "those during Sir Redvers Buller's operations in Natal
presented the most satisfactory features."</p>

<p>The line of communication with the base was short, and
it was amply supplied with hospital trains. In addition to
the one that had been formed before the outbreak of hostilities,
a second and similar train was prepared in November,
1889. The hospital train, "Princess Christian," constructed
in England at a cost of £14,000, mainly raised by
Her Royal Highness&mdash;with a handsome contribution from
the town of Windsor&mdash;reached Cape Town early in February,
1900. It was sent on in sections to Durban, where it was put
together in the Natal Government Railway workshops.
Under the charge of Sir John Furley, who had also supervised
its reconstruction, the train was the first to cross the
temporary trestle bridge provided to take the place of the
one across the Tugela, at Colenso, which had been destroyed
by the Boers, and it was, also, the first train to enter Ladysmith
(March 18, 1900) after the siege. Between this
time and September 5, 1901, it made 108 journeys, mainly
on the Natal side and on the Pretoria-Koomati Poort line;
it ran a total of 42,000 miles, and it carried (in addition to
the medical and nursing staff) 321 officers and 7,208 non-commissioned
officers and men, a total of 7,529 sick and
wounded, of whom only three died <i>en route</i>. In June, 1901,
the train was formally presented by the Central Red Cross
Committee to the Secretary of State for War as a complete
hospital train unit for the use of the military forces in
South Africa; but, on the assumption, apparently, that no
further use for its services as a hospital train was likely
to arise, it was subsequently dismantled.</p>

<p>As showing the extent of the work done by the other
hospital trains during the course of the war, it may be
added that No. 2 ran 114,539 miles, in 226 trips, between
November 22, 1898, and the end of August, 1902, conveying
471 officers and 10,325 non-commissioned officers and men,
a total of 10,796, of whom only seven died <i>en route</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Transvaal Railways and the War</span></h3>

<p>To the foregoing account of the British use of railways for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
military purposes during the course of the South African
War it may be of interest to add a few notes giving the experiences
of the Boers, as detailed in a statement on "The
Netherlands South African Railway Company and the
Transvaal War," drawn up at Pretoria, in April, 1900,
by the Secretary of the Company, Mr. Th. Steinnetz, and
published in <i xml:lang="de">De Ingenieur</i> of July 14 and 21, 1900.<a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Under the terms of the concession granted to the Netherlands
South African Railway Company (otherwise the <span xml:lang="de">Nederland
Zuid Afrikaansche Spoorweg Maatschappij</span>) by the
Government of the Transvaal Republic, the latter were, in
the event either of war or of danger of war, to have complete
control alike over the railway and over everything&mdash;and
everybody&mdash;necessary for its use, subject to certain
undertakings as to the payment of compensation to concessionaires.
By virtue of these powers the Executive
Raad issued a decree on September 13, 1899, establishing
Government control over the lines, and stating further:&mdash;"With
the view of ensuring that proper use can be made
of the railway, the whole of the <i>personnel</i> of the company
are ... commandeered to do duty on the railways in the
functions they now occupy, and they are placed under the
orders of the Commandant-General and the war officers
indicated by him, or of other officials." The Government,
in effect, took possession of all the lines, rolling stock, workshops
and other properties of the railway company for
the purposes of military transport, and they assumed control
over the staff in order to ensure the working, not only
of the company's own lines, but, also, of the lines in such
portions of British territory as might be occupied by the
forces of the Republic.</p>

<p>Against the possibility of an immediate invasion of the
Transvaal&mdash;"about which," says the statement, "there
was much anxiety on account of the armoured trains, which
the English advertised so loudly"&mdash;precautions were taken
by preparing for demolition some of the bridges on the
south-eastern section of the company's lines. Guards were,
also, stationed at bridges and other important points
throughout the Transvaal in order to protect them against
attack or interference by "the great number of Anglophiles"
assumed to be still in the Republic; but the statement seems
to suggest that, as shown by the small number of attempts
made in this direction, the British rather neglected their
opportunities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>
<p>In regard to the transport of Transvaal troops, difficulties
arose at the outset owing to the absence of data,
even of the vaguest character, as to the numbers of
burghers, horses and wagons it would be necessary to
convey by train. Consequently, no military time-tables
could be drawn up, and the traffic demands were met as
best they could be when they were made. No more, however,
than eleven trains a day, in each direction, could be
run on the south-eastern branch&mdash;a single-track line, with
stations and crossing places about one hour's journey apart.
Concerning the amount of traffic carried, Mr. Steinnetz
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The total military traffic to the frontier was not so great as
one would expect, in spite of only a portion of the burghers
having taken up arms. From various districts the commandos
marched mounted, with ox-wagons, to the place of assembly,
as had been the custom in the past, although the use of the
railway would have saved time and trouble to both horses and
men. Yet it was not the first time that the Transvaalers had
had the opportunity of learning the use of railways in warfare.
At the time of the Jameson Raid and the Magato Campaign
full use had been made of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among the railway bridges which the Boers had prepared
for destruction, in case of need, was an iron one of 116 ft.
span, the blowing up of which would have checked the
anticipated British invasion of the Transvaal via Lang's
Nek; but the concentration of the British forces at Dundee
and Ladysmith allowed the Boers to enter Natal without
resistance; and they took over, in sections, the working of
the Natal railway in proportion as they advanced. At
various stations in northern Natal long platforms had been
specially constructed by the British, and other arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
made, to permit of large movements of troops and
especially the detraining of cavalry. These improvements,
says Mr. Steinnetz, came in very handy for the Federal
Army. The <i>personnel</i> of the lines had "retired in a great
hurry," without attempting any demolitions or doing any
damage to the lines beyond what could be easily repaired.
The Lang's Nek tunnel was "wholly untouched." Mr.
Steinnetz continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Boers themselves, however, through fear of being surprised
by armoured trains, and for other reasons, gave the
breakdown gangs more work to do. The telegraph line was
destroyed by them for long distances, the track was broken
up and two bridges were damaged. In order to obstruct the
retreat of General Yule from Dundee a bridge of two 30-foot
spans on the Dundee branch line was blown up by the Irish
Brigade with a dynamite charge in the central pier. The damage
done was not very great and was easily repaired. The same
ineffective measure was applied with greater success to a similar
bridge over a small spruit near Waschbank. But even here
the repair was not difficult.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These admissions as to the ease with which the work of
destruction could, as a rule, readily be put right again are
in full accord with Sir Percy Girouard's report, in dealing
with the same subject. It is only fair to accept, in turn, the
assertion made by Mr. Steinnetz that the damage which the
British did to certain of the railway bridges was "speedily
repaired."</p>

<p>Some of the later destruction work carried out by the
Boers was of a more serious character. The blowing up of
the Tugela bridge at Colenso&mdash;a structure consisting of
five iron lattice girder spans of 100 ft. each on masonry
piles&mdash;was entrusted by the Boer military authorities to
an inspector of the railway company who had served in the
Dutch engineers. It was accomplished by the simultaneous
detonation of forty dynamite charges all connected by
leads to a Siemens and Halske "exploder," the bridge being
"thoroughly demolished." In the destruction of the
three-span bridge over the Orange River at Norval's Pont
the charge employed consisted of about three and a half
chests of dynamite, or 198 lbs. Concerning the general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
destruction of bridges by which the Boers sought to check
pursuit after their abandonment of the siege of Ladysmith,
Mr. Steinnitz says:&mdash;"There was no lack of explosives,
and no need to spare them."</p>

<p>The central workshops of the Netherlands Company
were made use of by the Government for the repair of guns,
rifles, wagons, etc., and for the manufacture of war material.
Four complete ambulance trains were also fitted up there
for the use of wounded burghers.</p>

<p>All the traffic on the lines was done on Government
orders, and all expenses were charged to them. No private
traffic at all was carried. There were, consequently, no
railway receipts, and the railway company had no responsibility.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Development of Rail Power</span></h3>

<p>In one way or another the South African War of 1899-1902
was concerned in many of the most complicated of
the problems that arise in connection with the use of
railways for military purposes.<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>In various ways, also, it advanced to a still further stage
the whole question of the nature and possibilities of rail-power
in war.</p>

<p>It confirmed under especially remarkable conditions a
fact which the American War of Secession had already
established, namely, that even single lines of railway,
passing through country occupied by or belonging to the
enemy, may allow of campaigns being conducted at such
distances from the base of supplies as, but for this means of
communication, would render war impracticable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>
<p>It offered further evidence as to the possibility, in favourable
circumstances, of employing railways for the carrying
out of important tactical movements.</p>

<p>It re-established the essential need of organisation for
the attainment of efficiency in military transport and
especially in so far as such organisation deals with questions
of control and co-ordination of the military and the technical
elements.</p>

<p>It placed on a recognised and clearly defined basis the
uses of armoured trains and the best methods to be adopted
for their construction and operation.</p>

<p>It showed still more clearly, perhaps, than any previous
war had done, the useful and beneficent purposes served
by ambulance and hospital trains, whether constructed for
the purpose or adapted from existing railway stock.</p>

<p>It proved that, however apparently insecure a line of rail
communication may be, and however active and destructive
the attacks made on it by a pertinacious enemy, yet, with
a strong and well-organised force of Railway Troops following
close on the advancing army, and supplemented by an
efficient system of line-protection, repairs and reconstruction
can be carried out with such speed that comparatively little
material delay will be caused, the final result of the campaign
will not necessarily be affected, and the value of rail-power
as an instrument of war will suffer no actual reduction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="smcap">The Russo-Japanese War</span></h2>


<p>The Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5 was a test not so
much of the military strength of the two combatants as of
their respective means of communication and concentration.</p>

<p>From Moscow to Port Arthur the distance is 5,300 miles,
and, save for the sea journey via the Baltic, the North Sea,
the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean, the Russians were dependent
for the transport of their troops and stores to
Manchuria on such very inadequate railways as they then
controlled. Japan, on the other hand, was able to rely on
her fleet and her considerably developed mercantile marine;
and, as soon as she had paralysed the Russian fleet and
established her own command of the sea&mdash;as she did within
two days of the outbreak of hostilities&mdash;she could land
her forces whenever she chose at almost any convenient point
on the sea-board of the theatre of war.</p>

<p>The situation recalled, somewhat, the still worse position
in which Russia had found herself at the time of the Crimean
War when, in the absence of any rail facilities at all, her
troops had to march, and their supplies and munitions had
to be conveyed, hundreds of miles over dreary steppes&mdash;"huge
columns that had quitted the far north and east of
the interior dwindling to a few broken-down Battalions
before they came in sight of Sebastopol"&mdash;whereas the
allies could send their troops all the way to the Crimea by
sea.</p>

<p>While there are many other causes which, rightly or
wrongly, have been regarded as contributing to the defeat
of Russia by Japan&mdash;included therein being personal shortcomings
of the Russian officers; mistakes made by them
in strategy and tactics; defects in the Russian military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
system, and the half-hearted interest of the Russian nation
in the struggle&mdash;the really decisive factors in the situation
were the transport deficiencies of the Siberian and Manchurian
railways.</p>

<p>The construction of a <i>Trans-Siberian Railway</i> as a great
strategic line stretching across Asia, facilitating the development
of a vast territory, and, above all, calculated to foster
the realisation of Russia's aims in the Far East, first came
under discussion about the year 1860. It was made the
subject of an exhaustive study by a Committee of Ministers
in 1875, but it was not until 1891 that the first sod was
turned.</p>

<p>Military and political considerations being paramount,
such energy was shown in the work of construction that by
1896 the western section had been carried through Irkutsk
to Lake Baikal and from the eastern shores thereof to
Strietensk, while the eastern section&mdash;known as the Usuri
Railway&mdash;had been made through Russia's Maritime Province
from Vladivostok to Khabarovsk. The original
design was that the line should be constructed on Russian
territory all the way to Vladivostok; but this meant that
from Strietensk it would have to follow the great bend made
to the north by the Amur, the southern boundary of Russia,
and the Russian Government thought it desirable to secure
a more direct route.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1896, in return for the great services
which she considered she had rendered to China in the war
between that country and Japan, Russia obtained the concession
for a railway which, starting from Chita, Trans-Baikalia,
about 200 miles west of Strietensk, would pass
through Manchuria to Vladivostok, avoiding the great bend
of the Amur, though still offering the disadvantage that one
important section of the through route would not be on
Russian territory. Under a contract made between the
Chinese Government and the Russo-Chinese Bank, a <i>Chinese
Eastern Railway Company</i> was formed to build and operate
the line thus conceded; but the arrangements made were
carried out through the Russian Minister of Finance, and
the line was directly dependent on the Russian State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Russia's occupation of Port Arthur in March, 1898,
led, in the spring of the following year, to the further construction
being begun of a southern branch of the Chinese
Eastern Railway from Harbin, a station on the Chita-Vladivostok
line, to the extremity of the Liao-tung peninsula.</p>

<p>It was these two railways, the Trans-Siberian and the
Chinese Eastern, terminating at Vladivostok in the one
direction and at Port Arthur in the other, which came into
special consideration in the war of 1904-5. It was on the
Trans-Siberian line, more especially, that Russia was mainly
dependent (as the German official report on the war points
out) not only for the concentration and maintenance of her
army but even for the raising and organisation of most of
its units.</p>

<p>When the Trans-Siberian was first built, the desire to
avoid undue expenditure on a line which must necessarily
involve a huge expenditure, with little or no prospect of
yielding a return sufficient for the payment of interest thereon,
led to the adoption of an economy which was to hamper
very materially the transport capacity of the railway. Only
a single line of rails was allowed for; a limit was placed on
the breadth of the embankments; the curves were greater
than considerations of speed and safety should have permitted;
the gradients were either dangerously varied or
so excessive that divisions of the trains were necessary; the
rails used were of no greater weight than from 42 lbs. to
47 lbs. per yard, and they were badly laid, even then;
the bridges across the smaller streams were made of wood
only; the crossing-places and the railway stations were few
and far between, while all the secondary constructions were
provided on what was almost the cheapest possible scale.</p>

<p>These conditions necessitated the limitation of the traffic,
when the line was first opened, to the running of three trains
a day in each direction. The length of the trains was restricted
to sixty axles. It was thus impossible to meet the
demands even of the ordinary traffic in peace time, apart
altogether from any question as to military requirements
in time of war. No sooner, therefore, were the main portions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of the line ready, in 1898, than there was set aside, for a railway
which was already to cost over £350,000,000, a further
sum of £9,130,000 for relaying those portions of the line
with a better quality of rails and sleepers, the reconstruction
of sections dangerous to traffic, the provision of more
stations and more rolling stock, and other improvements.
It was expected that this additional work would be completed
by 1904, by which time the line was to be equal to
the running of thirteen pairs of trains daily.</p>

<p>Reporting on the condition of the Russian railways in
1900 (at which date the Eastern Chinese line was still unfinished),
General Kuropatkin, then War Minister, afterwards
Commander-in-Chief in Manchuria, did not hesitate
to declare that it was still impossible for them to cope with
heavy traffic.</p>

<p>Relations between Russia and Japan became strained
towards the end of 1903, though the Government of the
former country were desirous that any outbreak of hostilities
should be avoided until they were better able to undertake
them. In his account of "The Russian Army and the
Japanese War" General Kuropatkin says concerning the
position at this period:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Our unreadiness was only too plain, and it seemed at that
time that we should be able, with two or three years' steady
work, so to strengthen our position in the Far East, and improve
the railway, the fleet, the land forces, and the fortresses of Port
Arthur and Vladivostok that Japan would have small chance
of success against us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding war as inevitable, and disinclined to give
Russia an opportunity of first strengthening her position
in the directions here suggested, Japan broke off diplomatic
relations with Russia on February 6, 1904, this being the
immediate prelude to the hostilities that followed.</p>

<p>In anticipation of a possible rupture, Russia had already
despatched reinforcements and stores to the Far East by
sea; but the rupture, when it did come, found her quite
unprepared to send further large reinforcements by land,
while her forces in the Far East were scattered over the
vast area extending from Lake Baikal to Vladivostok, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
from Port Arthur to Nikolaievsk. No orders for mobilisation
had been issued; the army was in the midst of rearmament
and reorganisation, and the unreadiness of the
railways had prevented the drawing up of time-tables for the
concentration of the troops. Ten days after the outbreak
of war the Russian Government issued a statement in which
they said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The distance of the territory now attacked and the desire
of the Tsar to maintain peace were the causes of the impossibility
of preparations for war being made a long time in advance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only, too, was the seat of war 5,000 miles away,
and not only was a single-track ill-equipped line of railway
the only practicable means of sending troops and
war material there by land, but an exceptionally great
obstacle to traffic had to be met owing to the interruption
of rail communication by Lake Baikal.</p>

<p>Having a length of 380 miles, a breadth ranging from
eighteen miles to fifty-six miles, a mean depth of 850 feet
(with a maximum, in parts, of no less than 4,500 ft.), and a
total area of over 13,000 square miles, <i>Lake Baikal</i> ranks,
next to the great lakes of the United States and Central
Africa, as the largest fresh-water lake in the world; though
it should, in reality, be regarded less as a lake than as a
great inland sea. As it happened, also, this vast expanse
of water stood in the direct line of route of the Trans-Siberian
railway, and the crossing of it by the Russian
reinforcements going to the Far East constituted a seriously
defective link in the chain of communication.</p>

<p>At an elevation of 1,360 feet above sea level, the lake is
subject alike to severe gales, to heavy fogs, and to frosts so
intense that in mid-winter the water may be frozen to a
depth of ten feet. From the end of April to the end of
December troops and travellers arriving by rail at one side
of the lake crossed to the other by passenger steamers. Goods
wagons were taken over by ferry-boats which, also, acted
as ice-breakers early and late in the winter season, so long
as the passage could be kept open. When, in the winter, the
ice was strong enough to bear, traffic was conducted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
transport sledges; but when there was sufficient ice to stop
the ferry-boats, though not sufficient to permit of the sledges
being used&mdash;conditions which generally prevailed for about
six weeks in the year&mdash;the traffic had to be discontinued
altogether.</p>

<p>The question will naturally be asked,&mdash;Why had not
the constructors of the line avoided these disadvantages
by carrying it round the lake? The reply is that this had
not been done, prior to the outbreak of war, owing to the
formidable nature of the work involved from an engineering
point of view.</p>

<p>Lake Baikal is bordered, on the south&mdash;the route a Circum-Baikal
line would have to take&mdash;by mountains which rise
sheer up from the water's edge to a height of, in places,
no less than 4,600 ft. Across the mountains, along the
rocky shores, and over the intervening valleys the railway
would require to be carried for a distance of 160 miles in
order to link up the two sections then divided by the lake.
The difficulties of the work were likely to be as great as
the cost would certainly be enormous, compared with that
of the remainder of the Trans-Siberian railway. So it was
that when the war broke out there were still 112 miles of
the Circum-Baikal line to be constructed.</p>

<p>So it was, also, that, pending the completion of this line
round the lake, Russia's reinforcements from Europe for
the Far East had to cross the lake itself; and the outbreak
of hostilities in the month of February placed Russia at an
especially great disadvantage in regard to transport.</p>

<p>The combined ferry-steamers and ice-breakers had
made their final journey for the winter on January 27,
and at first the only way in which the troops could cross
the ice was by marching or by sledge. After a day's rest
at Irkutsk, they were brought by train to Baikal station,
at the lake side, arriving there at about four o'clock in the
morning in order that they could complete the journey to
Tanchoi station, on the other side of the lake&mdash;a distance
of about twenty-five miles&mdash;in the day. The track was
marked out by posts, supplemented by lanterns at night,
and it was kept in order by gangs of labourers. Small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
bridges were placed over cracks in the ice. Shelters, in
telephonic communication with one another, were provided
at four-mile distances alike for the purpose of rest
and for the distribution of food prepared by regimental
field kitchens; but the principal meal of the day was taken
at a more substantial half-way house, where the cooking
arrangements were on a more elaborate scale and better
accommodation was provided. Around the half-way
house at night petroleum flares were burned, so that it
could be seen a long way off. In foggy weather, or during
snow storms, bells were rung at all the shelters. Inasmuch
as the temperature fell, at times, to 22 deg., Fahr., below
zero, the provision of these rest-houses must have been
greatly appreciated. Baggage was taken across in sledges,
the normal supply of which had been increased by an
additional 3,000. Some of the troops also made the journey
by this form of conveyance, four men being seated in each
sledge. The batteries crossed with their own horses.</p>

<p>As soon as the ice attained a thickness of about 4&frac12; ft.,
the expedient was adopted of laying a pair of rails along it
in order, more especially, that the additional engines and
railway wagons urgently needed on the lines east of the
lake could be taken across. The rails were laid on sleepers
of exceptional length, the weight being thus distributed
over a greater surface of ice; but, even with this precaution,
it was no easy matter to keep the line in working order
owing to the extreme cold, to storms, to the occasional
ice movements and cracks, or to the effect of earthquake
shocks in destroying lengths of line, sections of which
sometimes required to be relaid almost as soon as they
had been put down. The line was begun on February 10
and completed by the 29th of the same month. Between
March 1 and March 26 there were taken across the lake,
by this means, sixty-five dismantled locomotives (rebuilt
on arrival on the eastern side), twenty-five railway carriages,
and 2,313 goods wagons. Transport was provided by
horses, the number so used being about 1,000.</p>

<p>Constructed to serve an exclusively military purpose,
this twenty-five-mile line across Lake Baikal may certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
be regarded as a "military railway," while as a
military ice-railway it holds a unique position in the history
of warfare.</p>

<p>When, owing to the advancing season, the ice on the
lake could no longer be trusted to bear either railway
trucks or sledges, and when navigation was again open,
dependence had to be placed on the ferry services. There
were, however, only two vessels available for the transfer
of railway trucks across the lake, and each of these, accommodating
twenty-seven trucks at a time, could make no
more than three return crossings in the twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Only in one way could an improvement be effected in
these obviously inadequate facilities for getting an army to
Manchuria, and that was in carrying the railway round the
southern end of the lake, thus avoiding the delay caused by
the hitherto unavoidable transshipment and crossing, and
ensuring a continuous rail journey. The need for this
<i>Circum-Baikal link</i> had, in fact, become urgent, and the
work was pushed on with the greatest vigour.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the engineering difficulties
which the construction of the line involved. These
will be better understood if it is added that the 160-mile
link passes through thirty-four tunnels, having an aggregate
length of over six miles; that it is carried across
valleys, or open spaces, on two hundred bridges, and that
numerous cuttings and many large culverts had also to be
provided. The total cost worked out at no less than
£52,000 per mile&mdash;probably the largest sum per mile ever
spent on a railway designed, in the first instance, to serve
a distinctly military purpose, and exceeding by £35,000
the average cost per mile, down to that date, of the entire
system of Russian railways. Delays occurred, also, through
strikes and other causes, and, in the result, it was not until
September 25, 1904&mdash;more than seven months after the
outbreak of war&mdash;that the line was ready for use, and that
an interruption of the rail journey by the crossing of Lake
Baikal became no longer necessary.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an inadequate supply of engines and rolling
stock had been a serious hindrance to traffic alike on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Trans-Baikal section of the Siberian line and on the Eastern
Chinese lines. The locomotives and wagons taken across
Lake Baikal either on the ice-railway or on the ferry boats
had served a useful purpose, but six months elapsed before
the Eastern Chinese lines could be worked to their full
efficiency.</p>

<p>There were other directions, as well, in which <i>traffic
hindrances</i> arose. The freezing, down to the very bottom,
of the rivers between the eastern side of Lake Baikal
and Harbin (Manchuria) was a cause of serious difficulty in
the early part of the year in getting water even for such
locomotives as were available. In the western Siberian
section the supply of water was impaired by the great percentage
of salt in the streams. In Manchuria the fuel reserve
was inadequate; soldiers were the only reliable portion of
the subordinate railway staff; the railway workshops were
poorly equipped; there were not nearly enough engine
depôts; large supplies of rails, fish-plates, sleepers and ballast
were needed, and much work had to be done in the construction
of additional sidings, etc. All these shortcomings
required to be made good whilst the war was in actual
progress, though for the transport of most of the necessary
materials and appliances there was only a single-track
line of railway already overtaxed for the conveyance of
troops, munitions and supplies.</p>

<p>The <i>number of trains</i> that could be run was extremely
limited. The capacity of the line of communication as a
whole was fixed by that of the Eastern Chinese Railway
between Chita and Harbin; and after three months of war
it was still possible to run from west to east in each twenty-four
hours no more than three military trains (conveying
troops, supplies, stores and remounts), one light mail train,
and, when necessary, one ambulance train; though these
conditions were improved later on.</p>

<p>The <i>speed</i> at which the trains ran&mdash;allowing for necessary
stops in stations or at crossing places on the line&mdash;ranged
from five to eleven miles an hour, with seven miles an hour
as a good average. For the journey from Warsaw to Mukden
the military trains took forty days, including one day's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
rest for the troops at the end of every 600 or 700 miles. In
April and May the journey from Wirballen, on the frontier
of Russia and Germany, to Liao-yang, situate between
Mukden and Port Arthur, took fifty days&mdash;an average
speed of five and a quarter miles per hour.</p>

<p>What with the transport and other difficulties that arose,
it was not for three months after the outbreak of hostilities
that the Russian troops in the Ear East received reinforcements.
It was not until after seven months of war that
the three Army Corps sent from European Russia to join
the field army were all concentrated in Manchuria.</p>

<p>Under these conditions the Japanese, free to send their
own armies by sea to the theatre of war, and able to concentrate
them with far greater speed, had all the initial
advantage. The Russian reinforcements arrived in driblets,
and they were either cut off as they came or, as regards, at
least, the fighting from May 14 to October 14, provided
only 21,000 men to replace 100,000 killed, wounded or sick;
whereas the Japanese were able to maintain a continuous
flow of reinforcements to make good their own casualties.</p>

<p>General Kuropatkin is of opinion that if the Russians
had been able to command better transport from the
outset the whole course of the campaign would have been
changed. He thinks that even a single extra through troop
train per day would have made a material difference,
while the running, from the start, of six trains a day would,
he believes, have secured for Russia alike the initiative and
the victory. Referring to the Siberian and Eastern Chinese
Railways he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If these lines had been more efficient, we could have brought
up our troops more rapidly, and, as things turned out, 150,000
men concentrated at first would have been of far more value
to us than the 300,000 who were gradually assembled during
nine months, only to be sacrificed in detail.... If we had
had a better railway and had been able to mass at Liao-yang
the number specified, we should undoubtedly have won the
day in spite of our mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kuropatkin himself certainly did all he could to improve
the transport conditions. In a statement he submitted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the Tsar on March 7, 1904, he declared that of all urgently
pressing questions that of bettering the railway communication
between Russia and Siberia was the most important;
and he added:&mdash;"It must, therefore, be taken up at once,
in spite of the enormous cost. The money expended will
not be wasted; it will, on the contrary, be in the highest
sense productive inasmuch as it will shorten the duration
of the war."</p>

<p>On the Trans-Baikal section six new stations were added,
and additional crossing places to facilitate the passing of
trains were provided elsewhere, so that by May some
additional trains per day could be run. In June orders
were given by the Government for the execution of extensive
works designed to increase the capacity of the Siberian and
Eastern Chinese main lines to seven trains per day in each
direction, and that of the southern branch to twelve per day.
The cost of these improvements was estimated at £4,400,000.</p>

<p>In November, 1904, Kuropatkin submitted to the Tsar a
recommendation that the lines should be at once doubled
throughout their whole length. The reinforcements, he
declared, were even then still coming in driblets. "Supplies
despatched in the spring are still on the Siberian side.
Waterproofs sent for the summer will arrive when we want
fur coats; fur coats will come to hand when waterproofs are
wanted."</p>

<p>There was need, also, to provide stores of provisions for
the troops. So long as the army was a comparatively small
one it could depend mainly on local resources. In proportion
as it increased in size it became more and more
dependent on supplies from European Russia; but the
collection of a sufficiency for a single month meant the running
of five extra trains a day for a like period. Even
when ample supplies were available at one point, weakness
and inefficiency in the transport arrangements might lead
to the troops elsewhere suffering privations which should
be avoided.</p>

<p>Whether for financial or other reasons, the Russian Government
did not adopt the idea of converting the single track
of the railway system into double track; but the improvements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
made in the traffic facilities (including the provision
of sixty-nine additional places for the passing of trains)
were such that by the time peace was concluded, on September
5, 1905, the Russians had ten, or even twelve pairs
of full-length trains running in the twenty-four hours, as
compared with the two per day which could alone be run
six months before the outbreak of war and the three per day
which were running nine months later. The capacity of
the lines had been increased practically fourfold; though
the general situation remained such as to evoke the following
comment from the writer of the official German account
of the war<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In spite of the efforts made to improve the line, the connection
of the Russian forces in East Asia with their home country
was, and remained, an unreliable and uncertain factor in the
calculations of Army Headquarters. No measures, were they
ever so energetic, could be designed to remove this uncertainty,
and it was only gradually, as the Manchurian Army itself increased
and concentrated, and as the railway works advanced,
that greater freedom of action was assured to the Commander-in-Chief;
but even then the army as a whole, with all its wants
and supplies, remained dependent on the Siberian and Eastern
Chinese Railways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the railways did was to enable the Russians to collect
at the theatre of war, by the time the war itself came to an
end, an army of 1,000,000 men&mdash;of whom two-thirds had
not yet been under fire&mdash;together with machine-guns, howitzers,
shells, small-arm ammunition, field railways, wireless
telegraphy, supplies, and technical stores of all kinds.
Kuropatkin says of this achievement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The War Department had, with the co-operation of other
departments, successfully accomplished a most colossal task.
What single authority would have admitted a few years ago
the possibility of concentrating an army of a million men 5,400
miles away from its base of supply and equipment by means of
a poorly-constructed single-line railway? Wonders were
effected; but it was too late. Affairs in the interior of Russia
for which the War Department could not be held responsible
were the cause of the war being brought to an end at a time
when decisive military operations should really have only just
been beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>
<p>Russia, in fact, agreed to make peace at a time when the
prospect of her being able to secure a victory was greater
than it had been at any time during the earlier phases of the
war; but the Japanese failed to attain all they had hoped
for, the primary causes of such failure, in spite of their
repeated victories, being, as told in the British "Official
History" of the war, that "Port Arthur held out longer
than had been expected, and the Trans-Siberian Railway
enabled Russia to place more men in the field than had been
thought possible."<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Thus, in respect to rail-power, at least, Russia still achieved
a remarkable feat in her transport of an army so great a
distance by a single-track line of railway. Such an achievement
was unexampled, while, although Fate was against
the ultimate success of her efforts, Russia provided the
world with a fresh object lesson as to what might have
been done, in a campaign waged more than 5,000 miles
from the base of supplies, if only the line of rail communication
had been equal from the first to the demands it was
called upon to meet.</p>

<p>Apart from this main consideration, there were some
other phases of the Russo-Japanese War which are of
interest from the point of view of the present study.</p>

<p>The <i>Field railways</i>, mentioned on the previous page, constituted
a network of, altogether, 250 miles of narrow-gauge
railways built and operated by the Russian troops&mdash;either
alone or with the help of Chinese labourers&mdash;and designed
to act as subsidiary arteries of the broad-gauge Eastern
Chinese Railway by (1) providing for the transport therefrom
of troops and supplies to the front; (2) conveying
guns and munitions to the siege batteries, and (3) bringing
back the sick and wounded. Horses, ponies and mules
were employed for traction purposes. Each of the three
Russian armies in the field had its own group of narrow-gauge
lines, and the lines themselves served a most useful
purpose in a country of primitive roads and inadequate local
means of transport.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>
<p>In one instance a broad-gauge branch line was built
inland, during the course of the war, from the Eastern
Chinese Railway for a distance of twenty-five miles. A
depôt was set up at its terminus, and thence the supplies
were conveyed to the troops by a series of narrow-gauge
lines extending to every part of that particular section of
the theatre of war.</p>

<p>Construction of the narrow-gauge line serving the Second
Army, and extending nineteen miles from a point on the
Eastern Chinese Railway near to Port Arthur, necessitated
the provision of six bridges and three embankments. Three
lines, the building of which was begun in January, 1905,
were siege lines specially designed to serve the positions
taken up at Liao-yang; but all three were abandoned on
the evacuation of Mukden, early in March. It was, however,
subsequent to the retreat from Mukden that the
greatest degree of energy in constructing narrow-gauge
lines was shown by the Russians. In addition to the 250
miles brought into use, there was still another 100 miles
completed; but these could not be operated owing to the
inadequate supply of wagons&mdash;a supply reduced still
further through seizures made by the Japanese.</p>

<p>During the course of the war the traffic carried on these
military narrow-gauge lines included over 58,000 tons of
provisions, stores, etc., 75,132 sick and wounded, and
24,786 other troops.<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>For the carrying out of all this construction work, and,
also, for the operation of the Manchurian and Ussuri railways,
Russia had twenty-four companies of <i>Railway Troops</i>,
the total force of which was estimated at 11,431. In the
first part of the war she relied upon her six East Siberian
Railway Battalions. As the work increased other Battalions
were brought from European Russia.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>
<p>The Japanese were not well provided with Railway
Troops; but they were none the less active in endeavouring
to destroy the Russian lines of communication, on which
so much depended. For instance, the railway to Port
Arthur was cut by them near Wa-fang-tien at 11 p.m. on
May 6. The Russians repaired the line, and by May 10 a
further train-load of ammunition was sent over it into Port
Arthur. Three days later the Japanese cut the line at
another point, and from that time Port Arthur was isolated.</p>

<p>As regards the <i>operation</i> of the Siberian and Eastern
Chinese Railways, Colonel W. H. H. Waters says:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Taking the railway as a whole, from Chelyabinsk, which is
the western terminus of the Siberian portion, to Mukden, a
distance of close upon 4,000 miles, it has worked better than I
expected; but the one great fault connected with it has been,
and is, the incapacity of Russian railwaymen, civil or military,
to handle heavy station traffic properly. If Russia were to
pay a British or American goods-yard foreman, say from Nine
Elms station, a salary, no matter how high, and let him import
his own staff of assistants, the improvement of the Asiatic lines
in question would be remarkable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, again, Captain C. E. Vickers, R.E., writing on "The
Siberian Railway in War," in the issue of "The Royal
Engineers Journal" (Chatham) for August, 1905, points
to the need which was developed for the <i>control</i> of the
railway during war by a separate staff, as distinct from the
staffs concerned in arranging operations, distributing
supplies and munitions, and other military duties.</p>

<p>Whether due to the personal incapacity spoken of by
the one authority here quoted, or to the lack of a separate
organisation alluded to by the other, the fact remains
that the operation of the Siberian and Eastern Chinese
lines did give rise to a degree of confusion that must have
greatly increased the difficulties of the position in which the
Russians were placed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>
<p>When, for example, in September, 1904, reservists were
urgently wanted at Mukden after the retreat from Liao-yang,
the traffic was so mismanaged that it took the troops
seven days to do the 337 miles from Harbin&mdash;an average
speed of two miles per hour. On December 5, Harbin
Junction was so blocked in all directions by trains which
could neither move in nor go out that traffic had to be
suspended for twelve hours until the entanglement was
set right. Still further, after the fall of Port Arthur, on
January 2, 1905, and the augmentation of the Japanese
forces by Nogi's army, the arrival of reinforcements then
so greatly needed by the Russians was delayed for over one
month to allow of the forwarding of a quantity of stores
which had accumulated on the line.</p>

<p>Some, at least, of the difficulties and delays experienced
in operation were undoubtedly due to developments of that
<i>interference by individual officers</i> with the working of the
railways of which we have already had striking examples
in the case of the American War of Secession and the Franco-German
War of 1870-71. Colonel Waters writes on this
subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to note how the working of the line was interfered
with by those who should have been the first to see that
no extraneous calls were made upon it when the organisation
of the army and the strengthening of Port Arthur were of vital
importance.</p>

<p>The chief of the Viceroy's Staff was the intermediary between
Admiral Alexeiev and General Kuropatkin, the former being
at Mukden and the latter at Liao-yang, thirty-seven miles distant.
Frequent conferences took place between Kuropatkin
and this officer, who always used to come in a special train to
Liao-yang. This necessitated the line being kept clear for
indefinite periods of time and dislocated all the other traffic
arrangements, as the then chief of the railways himself declared.</p>

<p>In the first days of May, 1904, the Viceroy and the Grand
Duke Boris were at Port Arthur, and wished to leave it before
they should be cut off. I heard that they actually took three
special trains to quit Port Arthur, namely, one for each of them,
and one for their baggage and stores. This entirely upset the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>troop train, supply and ammunition services, at a time, too,
when the scarcity of heavy gun munition in the fortress was
such that, within a week, Kuropatkin called for volunteers to
run a train-load through, which was done a few hours only
before the place was definitely invested.</p>

<p>There were, throughout 1904, plenty of other instances of
special trains being run for, and siding accommodation occupied
by, various individuals, so that the organisation and maintenance
of the army was considerably hampered thereby.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These experiences simply confirm the wisdom of the
action which other countries had already taken (1) to ensure
the efficient operation of railways in time of war by staffs
comprising the military and the technical elements in combination,
and (2) to prevent the interference of the former
in the details of the actual working by the latter.</p>

<p>Russia was, in fact, distinctly behind Western nations in
these respects in 1904-5, and the need for placing her
military transport system on a sounder basis was among
the many lessons she learnt&mdash;and acted upon&mdash;as the result
of her experiences in the war with Japan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="smcap">Strategical Railways: Germany</span></h2>


<p>Between "strategical" and "military" railways there
are certain fundamental differences, just as there are, also,
between both of them and ordinary commercial railways.</p>

<p>While designed partly, mainly, or, it may be, exclusively,
to serve military purposes, strategical railways, unlike
military railways proper, form part of the ordinary railway
system of the country in which they are built. They
approximate to commercial lines in construction, equipment
and operation, and they are worked in connection
with them for the ordinary purposes of trade and
travel; though in their case any considerations as to
whether the traffic they carry is remunerative does not
arise, provided only that they are capable of fulfilling their
real purpose&mdash;that, namely, of ensuring such military
transports as may, sooner or later, be required of them. It
is possible that in times of peace the amount of actual
traffic passing over them will be comparatively small, if
not even practically <i>nil</i>, and that many years may elapse
before the special facilities they must necessarily offer,&mdash;such
as extensive siding accommodation and long platforms
for the loading and unloading of troop trains&mdash;are
likely to be employed to the fullest extent; but they nevertheless
form an integral part both of the railway system and
of the military system of the country, and, having been constructed,
they are, at least, available for military purposes
whenever wanted.</p>

<p>One must, however, again bear in mind that a railway
built to meet the ordinary requirements of trade and travel
does not become a "strategical" any more than a "military"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
railway simply because, in time of war, it is used, to
whatever extent, for the conveyance of troops, supplies or
war material. The essential factor in each instance is, not
the use that is made of the line, but the particular, or, at
least, the main object it has been built to serve. Just,
also, as a commercial line remains a commercial line notwithstanding
its use for military traffic, so, in turn, a
strategical line remains a strategical line whatever the
amount of civilian traffic it may carry in time of peace.</p>

<p>Yet while the distinction thus drawn between general
railways and strategical railways is abundantly warranted,
the increase of the former may still have an important
bearing on the operation of the latter because of the improvement
of transport facilities in the interior, and because
of the greater amount of rolling stock which will be made
available for war purposes. "From a military point of
view," said von Moltke in the Prussian <span xml:lang="de">Herrenhaus</span> on
March 26, 1876, "every railway is welcome, and two are
still more welcome than one"; and he developed this idea
in a further speech on December 17, 1879, when, in declaring
that the ownership and operation of the leading Prussian
railways was desirable from a military standpoint, he
said:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Railways have become, in our time, one of the most essential
instruments for the conduct of war. The transport of large
bodies of troops to a given point is an extremely complicated
and comprehensive piece of work, to which continuous attention
must be paid. Every fresh railway junction makes a
difference, while, although we may not want to make use of
every railway line that has been constructed, we may still want
to make use of the whole of the rolling stock that is available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another important distinction between military and
strategical railways is that whereas the building of the
former will be governed primarily by military requirements,
that of the latter may be fundamentally due to considerations
of State policy. Strategical railways are wanted to
serve the purposes of national defence or, alternatively, of
national expansion. They are especially provided to ensure
the speedy concentration of troops on the frontier, whether
to resist invasion by a neighbouring country or to facilitate
the invasion either of that country or, it may be, of territory
on the other side thereof. The fact that they have been
built may, in some cases, even further the interests of peace,
should the increased means they offer for military transports
render the country concerned a more formidable antagonist
than it might otherwise be, and influence the policy
of other States or lands accordingly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>
<p>In tropical dependencies the building of railways as a
practical proof of "effective occupation" is often regarded
as preferable to military conquest, being likely, in most
cases, to answer the same purpose while offering many other
advantages, besides. In West Africa there are not only
railways of this class but others that have, in addition,
been designed as a precautionary measure against a not
impossible invasion, at some future date, by Mohammedan
tribes from North Central Africa. All such lines as these
belong to the strategical type, though they may, also,
serve an important part in furthering the economic development
of the territories concerned.</p>

<p>Strategical railways, whether designed for defensive or
aggressive purposes, may, in turn, be divided into two main
groups, (1) those that constitute a network of lines; and
(2) single or individual lines for short or long distances.</p>

<p>A network of strategical railways is generally found in
direct association with frontiers. Single or individual
strategical lines fall into various groups including (1) short
lines or branches running out to some point on or near
to a frontier; (2) single lines carried for long distances,
and, possibly, crossing entire continents; (3) circular or
short lines, connecting different railway systems with one
another, in order to facilitate the movement of troops during
mobilisation or concentration or for defensive purposes in
the event of invasion; (4) lines passing round cities or
large towns in order to avoid delay of troop trains; and
(5) lines for coast defence.</p>

<p>The ideal conditions for a network of strategical railways<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
was already a subject of discussion in Germany in 1842,
when Pönitz brought forward his proposal that that country
should provide herself with such a system. There were, he
said, theorists who designed, on paper, strategical railways
which, starting from a common centre, radiated in straight
lines to different points on the frontier and were connected
with one another by parallel or intersecting lines of railway
on the principle of a geometrical design, or, he might have
added, of a spider's web. Pönitz admitted the excellence
of the idea, suggesting that if there were, indeed, a group
of lines to the frontier connected by cross lines allowing of
a complete interchange of traffic, the enemy would never
know at what point a sudden advance in force might not
be made, while the linking up of the entire system would
greatly facilitate working.</p>

<p>In practice, however, as he proceeded to point out, this
ideal system could not be fully adopted, partly because the
planning of railways is influenced by the configuration of
the country, which may not permit of geometrical designs for
iron roads; and partly because the trunk lines of national
systems of rail communication had already been laid by
private enterprise on the principle of catering for the social
and economic needs of the community and of returning
interest on capital expenditure, rather than of serving
military or political purposes.</p>

<p>In the proposals which Pönitz himself advanced for providing
Germany with a complete network of strategical
lines he sought to combine, as far as possible, the commercial
and the military principle; though the subsequent predominance,
in most countries, of the economic element in
regard to railways in general strengthened the force of his
contention that an ideal system was not necessarily a
practicable one. The suggested geometrical design was,
nevertheless, not lost sight of, and it continued to be regarded
as the plan that should, at least, be followed in
respect to strategical railways, as far as circumstances
would permit.</p>

<p>Dealing with this particular subject in his "<span xml:lang="de">Geschichte
und System der Eisenbahnbenutzung im Kriege</span>" (Leipzig,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
1896), Dr. Josef Joesten included the following among the
conditions which, theoretically and practically, should
enable a railway system to respond to the necessities of
war:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To each of the strategical fronts of the national territory
there should be the largest possible number of railway
lines, all independent the one of the other.</p>

<p>2. The converging lines terminating at the bases of concentration,
and more especially those leading to the coast
or to great navigable rivers, should be crossed by numerous
transverse lines in order to allow of the rapid passing of
troops from any one of the lines of concentration to any
other.</p>

<p>3. Positions or localities having a recognised strategical
value should be selected as the places where the two types
of lines should cross, and these intersection points, when
they are near to the frontier, should themselves be protected
by fortifications serving as <i xml:lang="fr">points d'appui</i> for movements
of advance or retirement.</p>

<p>It is possible that, if the building of railways in Germany
had been left entirely to the State from the outset, these
principles would have been generally followed there; but
in Prussia the private lines taken over as the result of
the policy of nationalisation adopted by that country&mdash;the
total length of those acquired since 1872 being now nearly
10,000 miles&mdash;had been originally constructed to serve, not
strategic, but economic purposes, and, more especially, the
industrial interests of Westphalia and the Rhineland, the
Government having been left by private enterprise to provide,
not alone the strategical lines, but, also, the lines that
were wanted to serve the less promising economic requirements,
of Eastern Prussia. To say, therefore, as some writers
have done, that the Prussian&mdash;if not the German&mdash;railways
as a whole have been designed to serve military purposes is
erroneous. It is none the less true that the adoption of the
principle of State ownership conferred alike on Prussia and
on other German States a great advantage in enabling them
both to build strategical lines as, ostensibly, part of the
ordinary railway system and to adapt existing lines to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
military purposes so far as conditions allowed and occasion
might require.</p>

<p>In these circumstances any close adherence to ideal
systems has, indeed, not been practicable; yet the activity
shown in Germany in providing either new or adapted
strategical lines of railway has been beyond all question.</p>

<p>Such activity has been especially manifest since the
Franco-German war of 1870-1. It is, indeed, the case
that during the last twenty-five years there have been constant
representations by Prussian trading interests that the
railways in Westphalia and Rhineland, numerous as they
might appear to be, were unequal to the industrial needs of
those districts. The reasons for these conditions were that
the Administration, eager to secure railway "profits," had
neglected to provide adequately for improvements, widenings
and extensions of line, and for additions to rolling
stock. No one, however, is likely to suggest that Prussia
has shown any lack of enterprise in the construction of
strategical lines which would enable her to concentrate
great masses of troops on her frontiers with the utmost
dispatch. "The rivalry between neighbouring States,"
writes von der Goltz in "The Conduct of War," "has had
the effect of causing perfectly new lines to be constructed
solely for military reasons. Strategical railways constitute
a special feature of our time"; and in no country has this
fact been recognised more clearly, and acted upon more
thoroughly, than in Germany.</p>

<p>It would, nevertheless, be a mistake to attempt to form
a reliable estimate of the situation, from a strategical point
of view, on the basis of the ordinary German railway maps,
and certain reproductions thereof recently offered in the
English Press have been wholly misleading. Not only
may these maps be hopelessly out of date&mdash;one, for instance,
that was published in a military journal in the autumn of
1914 contained none of the strategical lines built by Prussia
since 1900 for troop movements in the direction of Belgium&mdash;but
they invariably draw no distinction between State-owned
lines which do come into consideration in regard to
military transports and agricultural or other lines&mdash;including<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
many narrow-gauge ones&mdash;which serve local purposes
only and are still owned by private companies, the State
not having thought it necessary in the general interest to
take them over.</p>

<p>A more accurate idea of the real bearings of German
railways on the military and strategical situation can be
gathered from the large map ("<span xml:lang="de">Kartenbeilage I</span>") which
accompanies the "<span xml:lang="de">Bericht</span>" presented to the <span xml:lang="de">Kaiser</span>, in
1911, by the Prussian Minister of Public Works under
the title of "<span xml:lang="de">Die Verwaltung der öffentlichen Arbeiten in
Preussen, 1900 bis 1910</span>." On this map a clear distinction
is drawn between State-owned and company-owned lines,
while difference in colouring shows the additions made to
the State system during the decade either by construction
of new lines or by State acquisition of existing lines.</p>

<p>One especially noticeable feature brought out by this map
is the fact that, in addition to the innumerable railway
lines built either to the frontiers or establishing intercommunication
and exchange of traffic between those lines
themselves, there is an almost unbroken series running
parallel to the coasts of <i>Pomerania</i> and <i>East Prussia</i>, and
thence southward all along and close to the frontiers of
Russia and Russian Poland. In this way troops can be
moved, not only by different routes <i>to</i> many points along
the Baltic coast or the Russian frontier, but, also, <i>from</i> one
of these coastal or frontier points direct to another, as may
be desired.</p>

<p>The strategical significance of this arrangement is sufficiently
obvious; but any possible doubt as to the purpose
aimed at is removed by some observations thereon made
by Joesten, who further says in his "<span xml:lang="de">Geschichte und System
der Eisenbahnbenutzung im Kriege</span>":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If it is true that, generally speaking, the best railways for
general purposes constitute excellent lines of communication
for armies, it is no less true that good, or very good, strategical
lines cannot, and ought not to, in all cases constitute good commercial
lines. In support of this assertion one can refer to
the immense extent of railway lines on the coasts of Pomerania.
These lines, which are of the first importance from a strategical
point of view, have only a moderate value from a commercial
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>standpoint, considering that they do not connect the interior
of the country with any district providing goods or passenger
traffic on a material scale, and only provide means of communication
between localities having identical needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is thus admitted in regard to the coastal railways
of Pomerania applies no less to many, if not to most, of the
frontier lines in East Prussia, West Prussia and Silesia.</p>

<p>Not only, again, is the number of German lines going to
the frontiers, and no farther, out of all proportion to the
number of those providing for international communication,
but the map on which these observations are based shows
that between 1900 and 1910 there were added to the Prussian
State system many lines which (1) established additional
transverse links between those already going to the Russian
frontier, (2) provided alternative routes thereto, or (3) supplemented
the lines which skirt the frontier, a few miles
inland, by branches going therefrom to strategic points
actually on the frontier itself.</p>

<p>As against this construction of an elaborate network of
strategical lines towards and along <i>the Russian frontier</i>,
there must be put the fact that although, by this means,
Germany acquired the power to effect a great and speedy
concentration of troops on the frontier itself, her locomotives
and rolling stock would not be able to cross into Russia
and run on the railways there because of <i>the difference in
gauge</i>. On the eastern frontier the question as to how an
invasion in large force could be effected was, consequently,
quite different from that which would present itself on
the western frontiers, where the railway gauges of Belgium,
Luxemburg and France were the same as those of Germany.</p>

<p>It was certain that whenever, in the event of war, German
troops were able to enter Russian territory, Russia
would withdraw into the interior or else destroy such of
her locomotives and rolling stock as the enemy might otherwise
utilise for his own purpose. If, therefore, the Germans
wanted to use the existing Russian lines, they would either
have to build, in advance, locomotives and rolling stock
capable of running thereon, or they would have to convert
the Russian gauge of 5 feet to the German gauge of 4 feet 8½<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
inches, so that German trains could run on the other side of the
frontier. As already remarked on page <a href="#Page_61">61</a>, the reduction
of the broader gauge into a narrower one would involve
fewer engineering difficulties than an expansion of the German
gauge into the Russian gauge; yet even the former
procedure, if carried out over any considerable length of
line, would take up a good deal of time, and this would be
still more the case if the Russians, when they retreated,
destroyed the railway track and bridges behind them, as
they might confidently be expected to do.</p>

<p>Dependence, again, on the existing lines across the frontier
would, apart from questions of conversion and reconstruction,
still give Germany only a very small number of railway
routes into Russia, and these, also, at points where the
opposition offered might be especially active.</p>

<p>What, in these circumstances, Germany evidently planned
to do as soon as her troops crossed the frontier, in the event
of a war with Russia, was to supplement the strategical
lines on her own side of that frontier by military light railways
which, laid on the ordinary roads, or on clearances to
be effected, on Russian territory, would render her independent
of the ordinary railways there, while offering the further
advantage (1) that the laying of these narrow-gauge
military lines&mdash;in rough and ready fashion, yet in a way
that would answer the purposes of the moment&mdash;could be
effected in shorter time than the gauge-conversion and the
reconstruction of the Russian trunk lines would take; and
(2) that these military railways could be built from any
points along the frontier which were capable of being
reached direct from the German strategical lines, and offered
either an existing road or the opportunity of making one
for the purpose.</p>

<p>In the light of this assumption, one can understand more
clearly the reason for those short lines which, branching out
from the German strategical railways that run parallel to
the Russian frontier though some miles from it, are carried
to the frontier and there suddenly stop. It was, presumably,
from such terminal points as these that the laying of
the military railways on Russian territory would begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards the type of railways to be employed and the
preparations made in advance for supplying and constructing
them, we have the testimony of Mr. Roy Norton, an American
writer, who says in "The Man of Peace"&mdash;one of the
"Oxford Pamphlets, 1914-15," published by the Oxford
University Press:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On February 14 of this year (1914) I was in Cologne, and
blundered, where I had no business, into what I learned was a
military-stores yard. Among other curious things were tiny
locomotives loaded on flats which could be run off those cars
by an ingenious contrivance of metals, or, as we call them in
America, rails. Also there were other flats loaded with sections
of tracks fastened on cup ties (sleepers that can be laid
on the surface of the earth) and sections of miniature bridges
on other flats. I saw how it was possible to lay a line of temporary
railway, including bridges, almost anywhere in an incredibly
short space of time, if one had the men.... Before
I could conclude my examination I discovered that I was on
<i xml:lang="de">verboten</i> ground; but the official who directed me out told
me that what I had seen were construction outfits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Norton further quotes the following from a letter he
had just received from a Hollander who was a refugee in
Germany at the outbreak of the war, and reached home on
August 30, 1914:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Never, I believe, did a country so thoroughly get ready for
war. I saw the oddest spectacle, the building of a railway
behind a battle-field. They had diminutive little engines and
rails in sections, so that they could be bolted together, and
even bridges that could be put across ravines in a twinkling.
Flat cars that could be carried by hand and dropped on the
rails, great strings of them. Up to the nearest point of battle
came, on the regular railway, this small one.... It seemed
to me that hundreds of men had been trained for this task, for
in but a few minutes that small portable train was buzzing
backward and forward on its own small portable rails, distributing
food and supplies.... I've an idea that in time of battle
it would be possible for those sturdy little trains to shift troops
to critical or endangered points at the rate of perhaps twenty
miles an hour.... A portable railway for a battle-field struck
me as coming about as close to making war by machinery as anything
I have ever heard of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One may thus reasonably conclude, in regard to the Russo-German<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
frontier, (1) that the broader gauge of the Russian
railways would itself offer no real obstacle to the German
troops whenever the time came for their invading Russian
territory; (2) that in this eventuality the Germans would
be able, by reason of the preparations made by them in
advance, to lay down along the ordinary Russian roads
lines of military light railways already put together in complete
sections of combined rails and sleepers, which sections
would only require to be fastened the one to the other to be
at once ready for use; and (3) that these portable military
railways, to be built on Russian territory, were designed
both to supplement and to render still more efficient Germany's
network of strategical railways along her eastern
frontier.</p>

<p>In <i>southern Silesia</i> many improvements in the rail communication
with Austria were made in 1900-10. New
connections were established with the frontier railways,
offering alternative routes from interior points, while various
lines which stopped short of the frontier were extended to
it and linked up with Austrian lines on the other side.</p>

<p>In her relations with <i>France</i>, Germany's efforts to improve
still further her rail communications to the eastern
and north-eastern frontiers of that country have been continuous
since the war of 1870-1, on which campaign she
started with a great advantage over the French since she
was able to concentrate her troops on those frontiers by nine
different routes, namely, six in North Germany, and three
in South Germany, whereas France herself had then only
three available. The course adopted by Germany has been
(1) to secure a larger number of routes to the French frontier,
South Germany's three lines, for instance, being increased
to six; (2) to provide double track, or to substitute double
for single track, for lines leading to the frontier and having
a strategical importance; (3) to construct lines which cross
transversely those proceeding direct to the French frontiers,
thus allowing of intercommunication and transfer of traffic
from one to another; and (4) improvement of the interior
network of lines, with a view to facilitating military transport
services in time of war. "Altogether," says Joesten, "we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
have nineteen points at which our railways cross the Rhine,
and sixteen double-track lines for the transport of our
troops from east to west, as against the nine which were
alone available for concentration in 1870."</p>

<p>While showing all this activity on the immediate frontiers
of France, Germany was no less zealous in providing alternative
routes for a fresh invasion of French territory, the
adoption of this further policy being obviously inspired
by the energy that France was herself showing in the
strengthening of her north-east frontier against invasion.</p>

<p>One such alternative route was represented by <i>Luxemburg</i>.
Not only did Germany have lines of her own on the
north, south, and east of Luxemburg, but the lines within
the Grand Duchy itself had passed under German control;
and if Germany thought fit to disregard her treaty obligations,
and use the lines for strategical purposes, Luxemburg
was powerless to prevent her from so doing.</p>

<p>Another alternative route was by way of <i>Belgium</i>; and
the various developments of Germany's railway policy on
the Belgian frontier since 1908 point in an unmistakable
manner to deliberate preparation on her part for an invasion
of that country, whether for the purpose of passing through
it, as a means of reaching a more vulnerable part of French
territory than the strongly fortified north-east corner, or
in pursuance of designs against Belgium itself.</p>

<p>The full story of Germany's activity in this direction will
be found in a series of articles from the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>
reproduced by the author, Mr. Demetrius C. Boulger, in
"England's Arch-Enemy: A Collection of Essays forming
an Indictment of German Policy during the last sixteen
years" (London, 1914).<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The story opens with the establishment by Germany,
about the year 1896, of a camp at Elsenborn, ten miles
north-east of Malmédy, a town situate close to the Belgian
frontier and four miles from the Belgian town of Stavelot.
The camp was begun on a small scale, and at the outset the
establishment of it on the site in question was declared by
the Prussian authorities to have no strategical significance.
It steadily developed, however, in size and importance,
and its position, character and surroundings all suggested
that it was designed for aggressive rather than defensive
purposes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>
<p>At first the camp was reached from Hellenthal, a station,
fourteen miles away, on a light railway connected with the
lines in the Eifel district, between Cologne and Treves
(Trier), on the Moselle; but in 1896 a light railway was constructed
from Aix-la-Chapelle parallel with the Belgian
frontier as far as St. Vith, a distance of fifty miles, the main
purpose of this line being stated to be the securing of a
better connection, from Sourbrodt, for the camp at Elsenborn.
The line was, nevertheless, extended to <span xml:lang="fr">Trois Vièrges</span>
(Ger. <span xml:lang="de">Uflingen</span>), where it connected both with the railway
system of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg and with
the main lines of the Belgian System from Pepinster, via
Spa, <span xml:lang="fr">Stavelot</span>, <span xml:lang="fr">Trois Ponts</span> and <span xml:lang="fr">Gouvy</span>, to <span xml:lang="fr">Trois Vièrges</span>.
From <span xml:lang="fr">Trois Ponts</span> there is a direct route to <span xml:lang="fr">Liége</span>, while
<span xml:lang="fr">Gouvy</span>, situate only a few miles from <span xml:lang="fr">Trois Vièrges</span>, is the
junction both for Libramont, on the main line from Brussels
to Metz and Alsace, and for the further junction of Beatrix,
the central point of a Belgian line running parallel with the
French frontier from Dinant to Luxemburg.</p>

<p>The single-track line from Aix-la-Chapelle along the Belgian
frontier, supplemented by a light-railway branch from
Weismes to Malmédy, met all the traffic requirements of a
scantily-populated and primitive district, devoid alike of
industries and of local resources, and offering very little
traffic; but in 1908 the Prussian Government suddenly
decided to double the line, first as far as Weismes, and then
to St. Vith, notwithstanding that there was no apparent
justification for such a procedure. The widening involved,
also, the reconstruction of a high embankment originally
designed for one set of metals, a fact which showed that
only a few years previously&mdash;since when the local traffic
had not materially increased&mdash;there was no idea that a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
double-track line would ever be wanted. Still more significant
was the fact that, in addition to the second set of metals,
sidings were provided on such a scale at the stations <i>en
route</i>, in localities possessing only a dozen or so of cottages,
that, in the aggregate, trains containing a complete Army
Corps could have been accommodated on them. At one
station three sidings, each about 500 yards long, were supplied,
and at another a perfect network of sidings was constructed,
including two which were at least half a mile long
and were, also, equipped with turntables.<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The provision, more especially, of sidings such as these
at local stations where the trains were few and far between
and the ordinary merchandise was represented by some
occasional coal trucks, could have but one purpose. They
were obviously designed&mdash;in conjunction with the substitution
of double for single track&mdash;to permit of a large body
of troops, whether from Aix-la-Chapelle (an important
point of concentration for the Prussian Army, on mobilisation),
or elsewhere, being assembled in the immediate
neighbourhood of Weismes, the junction of the branch line
to Malmédy, for an invasion of Belgium. The doubling of
the rails as far as Weismes was completed by May, 1909.
It was afterwards continued to St. Vith, and so on to <span xml:lang="fr">Trois
Vièrges</span>.</p>

<p>We have thus far, however, got only the first chapter of
the story. The second opens with the further attempt of
the Prussian Government to secure an extension of the
Weismes-Malmédy line as a "light railway" across the
frontier to Stavelot, three miles east of Trois Ponts, thus
giving a shorter route from Aix-la-Chapelle and the camp
at Elsenborn to Liége, Namur, Louvain and Brussels, and
a second route to Gouvy for Libramont, Bertrix and the
north of France.</p>

<p>As the result of the influence they were able to bring to
bear on them, the Germans succeeded in persuading the
Belgian Government, not only to agree to the Weismes-Malmédy
branch being continued to Stavelot, but themselves
to build the greater part of this connecting link, and
even to cut, on the north of Stavelot, a tunnel without which
that town would have remained inaccessible by rail.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>
<p>Once more there could be no suggestion that this connecting
link, opened in October, 1913, was wanted in the interests
of the ordinary traffic, the needs of which were adequately
met by the diligence running twice a day between
Malmédy and Stavelot. What was really aimed at was a
rail connection with the Belgian system by means of which
the troops concentrated in those extensive sidings on the
Aix-la-Chapelle-St. Vith line could be poured into Belgium
in a continuous stream for the achievement of designs on
Belgium or&mdash;operating from either the Belgian or the
Luxemburg frontier&mdash;on France.</p>

<p>In helping to provide this connection, Belgium, as subsequent
events were to show, was in a position akin to that
of a man forced to dig the grave in which he is to be buried
after being shot; but Belgium, we are told, "yielded in
this and other matters because she could not resist without
support, and no support was forthcoming." There certainly
was an attempt to lull possible suspicions by the
designation of the Malmédy-Stavelot link as a "light railway."
It was, also, evident that the physical conditions
of the Weismes-Malmédy branch, with which it was to connect,
would not permit of any heavy traffic along it. But
the so-called "light railway" was built with the same gauge
as the main-line systems on each side of the frontier;
the powers obtained in respect to it allowed of trains being
run at a speed of forty miles an hour, as against the recognised
speed of sixteen miles an hour on light railways
proper; while no sooner had the link been established than
Germany discarded the defective Weismes-Malmédy branch
for the purposes of military transport, and built a new line
from Malmédy to Weywertz, a station to the north or north-east
of Weismes. This Malmédy-Weywertz branch would,
it was understood, be used exclusively for military traffic,
and the station at Weywertz was, in due course, provided
with its own extensive platforms and network of sidings
for the accommodation of troop trains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>We now come to the third chapter of the story; and here
we learn that what was happening in the immediate proximity
of the German-Belgian frontier was but part of a much
wider scheme, though one still designed to serve the same
purpose&mdash;that, namely, of ensuring the invasion of Belgium
by German troops with the greatest facility and in the least
possible time.</p>

<p>From Weywertz, the new junction for Stavelot and the
Belgian railways in general, the Germans built a line to
<span xml:lang="de">Jünkerath</span>, a station north of <span xml:lang="de">Gerolstein</span>, on the line from
Cologne to Treves. Then from Blankenheim, immediately
north of <span xml:lang="de">Jünkerath</span>, and from Lissendorf, on the south of
the same station, there were opened for traffic, in July, 1912,
new double-track lines which, meeting at <span xml:lang="de">Dümpelfeld</span>, on
the existing Remagen-Adenau line, gave a through route
for troops from the Rhine, across the Eifel district to Weywertz,
and so on to Stavelot for destinations (in war-time)
throughout Belgium, Luxemburg, or along the northern
frontier of France.</p>

<p>This direct route to Belgium offered the further advantage
that it avoided any necessity for troops from the Rhine to
pass through Cologne, where much congestion might otherwise
occur. It also left the Aix-la-Chapelle-Weywertz
route free for troops from Cologne and Westphalia, while
a further improvement of the facilities for crossing the
Rhine made Remagen still more accessible for troops from
all parts of Central Germany destined for Belgium&mdash;and
beyond.</p>

<p>Reference to the Prussian State Railways official map
shows, also, (1) a new line from Coblenz which joins, at
Mayen, the existing railway from Andernach, on the Rhine,
to Gerolstein, in the Eifel, whence the Belgian border can be
reached either via <span xml:lang="de">Jünkerath</span> and Weywertz or via <span xml:lang="de">Lammersweiler</span>
and the Luxemburg station of <span xml:lang="fr">Trois-Vièrges</span>;
(2) the extension to Daun, also on the Andernach-Gerolstein
route, of a short branch on the Coblenz-Treves Railway which
previously terminated at Wittlich; and (3) several other
small lines in the Eifel district, offering additional facilities
for the concentration of troops on the Belgian frontier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>So the Malmédy-Stavelot "light railway"&mdash;especially
in view of this series of new German lines all leading thereto&mdash;had
become a railway of the greatest strategical importance;
and the fourth chapter of the story (though one
upon which it is not proposed to enter here) would show
how this network of strategical lines, developed with so
much energy and thoroughness, was brought into operation
in 1914 immediately on the outbreak of war, and, from that
time, constituted one of the main arteries for the passage
of German troops to and from Belgium and Northern
France.</p>

<p>In regard to <i>Holland</i>, one finds a new line of railway from
Jülich&mdash;a station reached from Düren, on the main line
between Cologne and Aix-la-Chapelle&mdash;to Dalheim, the
German frontier station on the direct line from Cologne via
Rheydt to Roermond, a Dutch station on the right bank
of the Meuse (which is here crossed by two bridges), and
thence through the Belgian stations of Moll and Herenthals
and across the flat expanse of the Campine to Antwerp.</p>

<p>This line obviously offers an alternative route for the
transport of troops from Cologne and Aix-la-Chapelle to
Dalheim; but of still greater significance is the information
given by the writer of the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> articles as to
the changes carried out at Dalheim itself, transforming
that place from "an unimportant halting-place" into "a
point of concentration of great strategical importance"
on the frontiers of Holland.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the line from Dalheim to Roermond and
on to Antwerp was already a double one, the alterations
made at Dalheim were confined to a liberal provision of
railway sidings in order that, as we have seen was done on
the Belgian frontier, a large body of troops could be concentrated
for a possible invasion, in this instance, either of
Holland itself, or of Belgium by the alternative route across
the south-eastern corner of Dutch territory.</p>

<p>One of the Dalheim sidings, about a quarter of a mile in
length, situate on a high embankment; and, in order
that it could be reached without interfering with other
traffic, a bridge over which the main line runs east of Dalheim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
station was widened to allow of the laying across it of
a third pair of rails. Other sidings adjoining Dalheim
station have no fewer than ten pairs of parallel rails, and
there are still others on the west of the same station, towards
the Dutch frontier. At Wegberg and Rheydt, east
of Dalheim, further sidings were provided which, like those
at Dalheim, would not possibly be required for other than
military reasons.</p>

<p>Summing up the situation in regard alike to the Belgian
and the Dutch frontiers, Mr. Boulger remarks, in his article
of February, 1914:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thus on an arc extending from Treves to Nijmegen (excluding
from our purview what is called the main concentration on
the Saar, behind Metz), the German War Department has
arranged for a simultaneous advance by fourteen separate
routes across Holland, Belgium and the Grand Duchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In view of all these facts, there is no possible room for
doubt as to the prolonged and extensive nature of the preparations
made by Germany for the war she instigated
in 1914; but the particular consideration with which we
are here concerned is that of seeing to what extent those
preparations related either to the construction of strategical
lines of railway or to the adaptation of existing lines
to strategical purposes.</p>

<p>Leaving Belgium and Holland, and looking at the Prussian
State lines in <i>Schleswig-Holstein</i>, one finds on the
official map the indication of a new line (partly built and
partly under construction in 1910) which, starting from
Holtenau, at the mouth of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in
the Baltic, continues the short distance to Kiel, then turns
to the west, connects with the Neumünster-Vandrup main
line to Denmark, crosses the canal, and so on to Husum,
a junction on the Altona-Esbjerg west-coast route. This
new line would evidently be of strategical advantage in
moving troops from Kiel either for the defence of the Kaiser
Wilhelm Canal or to resist invasion by sea on the north of
the waterway. Then the existing line from Kiel through
Eckernförde to Flensburg, on the Neumünster-Vandrup
route to Denmark, and giving through connection from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Kiel to Tondern and Hoyer on the west coast&mdash;has been
"nationalised," and so added to the Prussian State system;
while from two stations just to the north of Flensburg there
are short new lines which, meeting at Torsbüll, continue to
the Alsener Sund, on the west of the Little Belt, and may&mdash;or
may not&mdash;be of value in improving Prussia's strategical
position in this corner of the Baltic, and in immediate
proximity to the Danish island of Fünen.</p>

<p>Finally a large number of additions have been made in
recent years to the State Railway systems in the interior
of Germany; and, although a good proportion of these
may have been provided to meet the increased economic
and social needs of the German people, many of them must
be regarded as strategical lines designed to facilitate (1) the
mobilisation of troops on the outbreak of war; (2) their
concentration, by routes covering all parts of the Empire,
as arranged long in advance; and (3) their speedy transfer
across country from one frontier to another, should several
campaigns be fought at the same time.</p>

<p>The resort by Germany to strategical railways in Africa
and elsewhere, as a means of furthering her Weltpolitik, will
be dealt with in the two chapters that follow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="smcap">A German-African Empire</span></h2>


<p>Strategical railways in South-West Africa were built
by Germany as a means towards the achievement of her
designs on British South Africa; but these, in turn, were
only part of a still greater plan having for its purpose the
transformation of Africa as a whole into a German-African
Empire which should compare in value, if not in glory,
with that of the Indian Empire itself.</p>

<p>Colonisation societies began to be formed in Germany
as early as 1849; though in the first instance the aims of
their promoters were directed mainly to such parts of the
world as Brazil, Texas, the Mosquito Shore, Chili and
Morocco. All such places as these, however, offered the
disadvantage that Germans going there could only become
foreign settlers under the more or less civilised Powers
already in possession.<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In the 60's and 70's of the nineteenth
century attention in Germany began to be diverted,
rather, to Africa as a land where vast expanses, possessing
great prospects and possibilities, and not yet controlled
by any civilised Power, were still available not only for
colonisation but for acquisition. So it was that successive
German travellers explored many different parts of Africa
and published accounts of their journeys designed, not
merely as contributions to geographical science, but, also,
to impress a then somewhat apathetic German public with
the importance of their acquiring a "footing" on the
African continent. In 1873 a German Society for the
Exploration of Equatorial Africa was founded. This was
followed in 1876 by the German African Society, and subsequently
these two bodies were combined under the name
of the Berlin African Society.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>
<p>Not long after this, evidence was forthcoming that something
far more than the settling of German colonists in
Africa and the securing of a "footing" on African soil by
Germany was really being kept in view.</p>

<p>In 1880 Sir Bartle Frere, at that time Governor of the
Cape and High Commissioner for South Africa, forwarded
to Lord Kimberley a translation of an article which had
just been contributed to the <i xml:lang="de">Geographische Nachrichten</i> by
Ernst von Weber; and, in doing so he informed the Colonial
Secretary that the article contained "a clear and well-argued
statement in favour of the plan for a German colony
in South Africa which was much discussed in German
commercial and political circles even before the Franco-German
War, and is said to have been one of the immediate
motives of the German mission of scientific inquiry which
visited southern and eastern Africa in 1870-71."</p>

<p>Von Weber's proposals<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> pointed, however, to the creation,
not simply of "a German colony" in South Africa, but of
a German Empire in Africa. "A new Empire," he wrote,
"possibly more valuable and more brilliant than even the
Indian Empire, awaits in the newly-discovered Central
Africa that Power which shall possess sufficient courage,
strength and intelligence to acquire it"; and he proceeded
to show (1) why Germany should be this Power, and (2)
the means by which she might eventually secure control
of the whole country.</p>

<p>The establishment of trading settlements was to ensure
for the Germans a footing in the districts north of the
Transvaal, and this was to be followed by the flooding of
South Africa generally with German immigrants. The
Boers spread throughout South Africa were already allied
to the Germans by speech and habits, and they would, he
thought, be sure to emigrate to the north and place themselves
under the protection of the German colonies there,
rather than remain subject to the hated British. In any
case, "a constant mass-immigration of Germans would
gradually bring about a decided numerical preponderance
of Germans over the Dutch population, and of itself would
effect the Germanisation of the country in a peaceful
manner. It was," he continued, "this free, unlimited
room for annexation in the north, this open access to the
heart of Africa, which principally inspired me with the
idea, now more than four years ago, that Germany should
try, by the acquisition of Delagoa Bay and the subsequent
continued influx of German immigrants into the Transvaal,
to secure future dominion over the country, and so pave
the way for the foundation of a German-African Empire
of the future."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>
<p>The procedure to be followed was (1) the acquiring of
territory in Africa by Germany wherever she could get it,
whether in the central or in the coastal districts; (2) co-operation
with the Boers as a step towards bringing them
and their Republics under German suzerainty; and (3)
the overthrow of British influence, with the substitution
for it of German supremacy.</p>

<p>These ideas gained wide acceptance in Germany; they
became a leading factor in the colonial policy of the Imperial
Government, and they reconciled the German people,
more or less, to the heavy burdens which the developments
of that policy were to involve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">German South-West Africa</span></h3>

<p>The first steps towards the attainment of the aspirations
entertained were taken by Herr Adolf Lüderitz, a Bremen
merchant who, acting under the auspices of the German
Colonial Society, and having received from the Imperial
Foreign Office assurances of its protection, established a
trading settlement, in April, 1883, in the bay of Angra
Pequeña, situate between Namaqualand and Damaraland
on the west coast of Africa, and about 150 miles north of
Orange River, the northern boundary of Cape Colony.
Acquiring from a Hottentot chief a stretch of territory 215
miles in extent in the Hinterland of Angra Pequeña, Lüderitz
raised the German flag in the settlement, which thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
became Germany's first colony. Further concessions of
territory were obtained, and in September, 1884, Germany
announced that the west coast of Africa, from 26 degrees S.
latitude to Cape Frio, excepting Walfisch Bay (declared
British in 1878), had been placed under the protection of
the German Emperor. A treaty made between England
and Germany in 1890 defined the limits of the German
South-West African Protectorate as bounded on the south
by the Orange River and Cape Colony, on the north by
Portuguese Angola, on the west by the Atlantic, and on
the east by British Bechuanaland, with the so-called "Caprivi
Strip," giving Germany access from the north-east
corner of her Protectorate to a point on the Zambezi River
north of Victoria Falls.<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The total area comprised within
these boundaries was about 322,200 square miles.</p>

<p>At the outset, the new Protectorate aroused little enthusiasm
in Germany as a colony where her surplus population
could hope to settle and prosper under the German flag
instead of going to foreign countries, as so many thousands
of Germans were then doing. On a coast-line of 900 miles
there was no good natural harbour except the one at Walfisch
Bay, owned by the British. Swakopmund and Lüderitzbucht,
on which the German colonists would have to
rely, were then little better than open roadsteads. Considerable
expanses of the territory itself consist of drought-stricken
desert. The rainfall in Damaraland and Namaqualand
averages only about three inches a year. In
certain districts a period of five or six years has been known
to pass without any rain at all. A record of rainfall on
some parts of the coast has shown a total of one-fifth of
an inch in the course of twelve months. At Walfisch Bay
the British settlement imports its fresh water from Capetown.
On the higher of the series of plateaux rising gradually
to the Kalahari desert the climatic conditions are more
favourable, and the better rainfall in the north-east allows
of good crops being grown, while various sections are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
favourable for stock-raising. In later years, also, various
deposits of copper were found in the district of Otavi, some
400 miles from Swakopmund, and diamond fields, which
yielded nearly £1,000,000 worth of stones in the first year,
were discovered east of Lüderitzbucht in 1908. But in
Germany the Protectorate was regarded as a desirable
acquisition mainly, if not exclusively, because of the advantages
it was expected to afford as a base for the eventual
creation of a German-African Empire.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Herero Rising</span></h3>

<p>The attainment of this higher purpose seemed likely
to be furthered as the result of the steps taken to suppress
the risings of the Hereros and the Hottentots between the
years 1903 and 1907. Not only did the reinforcements
sent out from Germany assume such proportions that at
one time the Germans are said to have had no fewer than
19,000 men under arms in the Protectorate, but the troops
took with them a plentiful supply of pom-poms, mountain
guns, field guns and Maxims of various kinds, the <i xml:lang="fr">Revue
Militaire des Armées Étrangères</i> being led to remark thereon
that "the German columns had an unusually large proportion
of artillery, roughly two batteries to three companies
of mounted infantry; and it is difficult to believe that so
many guns were necessary, especially as the Hereros had
no artillery at all.<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Probably," the <i xml:lang="fr">Revue</i> continued, "the
artillery could have been dispensed with altogether; and
had this been done, the columns would have been rendered
more mobile."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>
<p>The military measures taken appeared to be in excess
of requirements even when allowance was made for the
fact that the campaign was fought in difficult country
and that the Germans themselves lost about 5,000 men;
but the real significance of the policy adopted lay in the
keeping of a considerable proportion of the German expeditionary
force in the colony after the rising had, with German
thoroughness, been effectively crushed.</p>

<p>This procedure attracted attention and adverse comment
even in Germany, where doubts were already being
entertained as to whether good value was being received
for the £30,000,000 which the suppression of the troubles
had cost. It was, however, made clear that the still considerable
body of German troops left in the colony was
being kept on hand there in case of the opportunity arising
for its employment in another direction&mdash;that, namely,
of achieving Germany's aspirations in regard to the conquest
of British South Africa, and the final elimination of
British influence from Africa in general.</p>

<p>Evidence both as to the nature of these continued aspirations
and as to the further purpose it was hoped the troops
on the spot might effect was forthcoming in various directions.</p>

<p>In a book of 416 pages, published in 1905, under the title
of "<span xml:lang="de">Das neue Südafrika</span>," Dr. Paul Samassa emphasised
the part which the German people had taken in the settlement
of South Africa; pointed to the close relationship
and affinity of feeling between Germans and Boers; encouraged
the idea of their mutually looking forward to the
opening up of South Africa as "a land of settlement for
the German race," and said, further:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>German South-West Africa is, to-day, a strong tramp card
in our hands, from the point of view of <span xml:lang="de">Weltpolitik</span>. In England
much has been said of late as to what a good thing it would
be for that country if our fleet were annihilated before it became
dangerous.... On our side we might cool these hot-heads,
and strengthen the peace party in England, if we reminded
them that, whatever the loss to ourselves of a war with that
country, England would run a greater risk&mdash;that of losing
South Africa. We have in German South-West Africa to-day
about 12,000 troops, of whom one-half will remain there for
a considerable time. In the event of a war between Germany
and England the South African coast would naturally be blockaded
by England; and there would then be nothing left for
our troops to do but to go on to Cape Colony&mdash;for their food
supplies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In so doing they could, he argued, count upon the support
of the Boers, of whom there were 14,000 opposed to
the English at the end of the South African war. As
against this possible concentration of German troops and
Boers there was the fact that the English garrison in South
Africa did not exceed 20,000. So, he added, the people
in England could consider "what an incalculable adventure
a war with Germany might be, notwithstanding the superiority
of the English fleet."</p>

<p>Speaking in the Reichstag in February, 1906, Herr
Ledebour called attention to the fact that Major von François,
who at one time was in command of German South-West
Africa, had declared, in his book, "<span xml:lang="de">Nama und
Damara</span>," issued three months previously, that fewer than
one thousand troops would suffice to maintain order in
the colony; and Herr Ledebour added:&mdash;"For two years
imaginative Pan-German politicians have been disseminating
the idea that a large force must be maintained in South-West
Africa for the purpose of exercising in the sphere of
Weltpolitik pressure upon England, with the eventual
object of invading Cape Colony."</p>

<p>There is the testimony, also, of "An Anglo-German,"
who, in the course of an article on "German Clerks in
British Offices," published in <i>The London Magazine</i> for
November, 1910, tells the following story:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>During a recent stay in Germany I was introduced by a man
I know to be one of the chief functionaries of the Commerce
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>Defence League<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> to a friend of his who had just returned from
German South-West Africa. On a subsequent meeting I entered
into conversation with this gentleman, and made inquiries
about German progress in that part of the world. He answered
my questions without reserve. Little headway was being
made, and little was looked for. Men and money were being
freely expended, without present return. The only good harbour
(Walfisch Bay) is a British possession, as likewise are all
the islands of any value which are dotted along the coast.</p>

<p>"Why then," was my inevitable query, "do the Germans
persist in their occupation of the country?"</p>

<p>He smiled craftily.</p>

<p>"We Germans look far ahead, my friend," he replied. "We
foresee a British débácle in South Africa, and we are on the
spot. Thanks to the pioneers of our excellent League, our
plans are all matured. The League finances the scheme and
the Imperial Government supplies the military forces. By
cession&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;Walfisch Bay will before long be German
territory; but in the meantime British Free Trade opposes
no obstacle to us, and we can pursue our purpose unmolested."</p>

<p>"But what is that purpose?" I asked, with the object of
leading him on.</p>

<p>"Surely you are not so blind as to need enlightenment!" was
his reply. "Germany has long regarded South Africa as a
future possession of her own. When the inevitable happens,
and Great Britain finds her hands full elsewhere, we are ready
to strike the moment the signal is given, and Cape Colony,
Bechuanaland, Rhodesia&mdash;all frontier States&mdash;will fall like
ripe apples into our grasp."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order, however, that Germany might be prepared
thus to take action at a moment's notice, two things were
essential, in addition to having troops on the spot, namely,
(1) that the colony should possess railways within striking
distance alike of the Cape, of Bechuanaland and of Rhodesia;
and (2) that the military preparations as a whole
should be so complete as to be ready for any emergency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Railways in G.S.W. Africa</span></h3>

<p>Railways were indispensable on account, not only of the
considerable distances to be covered, but, also, of the
sand-belts and stretches of desert across which the transport
of troops and stores would be a matter of great difficulty
without the help of railways. They were, in fact, a vital
part of the whole scheme.</p>

<p>Following on Germany's annexation of Damaraland
and Great Namaqualand, and her conversion of them into
the Protectorate of German South-West Africa, a party
of German engineers and surveyors landed at Swakopmund
with the design of planning a line of railway to be constructed
from that point to Windhoek, and thence across
the Kalahari desert to the Transvaal. About the same
time, also, Germans and Boers were alike working to secure
as much of Bechuanaland as they could, without attracting
too much attention to their proceedings. A realisation
of these further aims might have been of great value to
Germany in facilitating the attainment of her full programme
in respect to Africa; but the scheme was frustrated
by Great Britain's annexation of Bechuanaland
in September, 1885, the result of the step thus taken being
to drive a wedge of British territory between German
South-West Africa and the Boer Republics.</p>

<p>So the railway in question got no further east than Windhoek,
the capital of the colony, a distance inland of 237
miles.</p>

<p>Having failed in one direction, Germany tried another.
Under a concession granted to them in 1887 by the Government
of the Transvaal Republic, a group of Dutch, German
and other capitalists, constituting the Netherlands South
African Railway Company, built a railway from Delagoa
Bay to Pretoria; and the new aim of Germany was, apparently,
to make use of this line, and so get access to the
Transvaal&mdash;and beyond&mdash;from the east coast instead of
from the west.</p>

<p>Confirmation of this fact is to be found in "A Brief
History of the Transvaal Secret Service System, from its
Inception to the Present Time," written by Mr. A. E.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Heyer, and published at Cape Town in 1899. The writer
had held a position in the Transvaal which enabled him
to learn many interesting facts concerning the working
of the system in question. Among other things he tells
how, at Lisbon, every effort was made to obtain a port in
Delagoa Bay, and how, "aided by Germany, Dr. Leyds
approached Lisbon over and over again with a view to
get Delagoa Bay ceded to the Transvaal"; though the
Doctor got no more from the Portuguese authorities than a
reminder that, under the London Convention of 1884, the
South African Republic could conclude no treaty or engagement
with any foreign State or nation (except the Orange
Free State) until such treaty or engagement had been
submitted to the Queen of England for her approval.</p>

<p>That Germany, in giving her "aid" in these matters
to the Transvaal Republic, was inspired by a regard for
the furthering of her own particular schemes is beyond
all reasonable doubt; but Mr. Heyer shows, also, that
when the negotiations with Portugal were unsuccessful,
there was elaborated a scheme under which Germany and
the Transvaal were to get what they wanted by means of
a <i xml:lang="fr">coup de main</i>. Mr. Heyer says on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have before me a copy of a document, dated Pretoria,
August 24, 1892 (the original of which is still in a certain Government
office in Pretoria), wherein a Pretoria-Berlin scheme is
detailed, namely, "How a few regiments of Prussian Infantry
could be landed at Delagoa Bay and force their way into Transvaal
territory, and, 'once in,' defy British suzerainty, and for
all time 'hang the annoying question of her paramountcy on
the nail.'" The name of Herr von Herff, then German Consul
at Pretoria, appears on the document. Any one reading this
cleverly-planned "Descent on Delagoa" would be readily
convinced as to how very easily a German raid on Delagoa
territory could be successfully accomplished.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This project, also, proved abortive, and, in default
of Delagoa Bay, Germany had still to regard her South-West
African Protectorate, with its railways and its armed
forces, as the base from which British interests were to
be wiped out&mdash;sooner or later&mdash;from the Cape to Cairo.</p>

<p>At the time of the outbreak of war in 1914, the principal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
railways in German South-West Africa&mdash;apart from some
minor lines which do not come into consideration&mdash;were as
follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">

</div>

<p>Granting that the Northern Railway was needed to
afford a means of communication between Swakopmund
and the capital of the colony, and that the original purpose
of the Otavi line was to provide an outlet for the copper
obtained from the mines in that district, it is, nevertheless,
the fact that the Southern and the North-to-South lines
were designed to serve what were mainly or exclusively
strategical purposes.</p>

<p>When the building of the first section of the Southern
line&mdash;from Lüderitzbucht to Aus&mdash;was under consideration
in the Reichstag, one of the members of that body,
Herr Lattmann, recommended that the vote should be
passed without being referred to a committee; and in
support of his recommendation he said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This way of passing the vote would be of particular importance
for the whole nation, since the railway would not then have
to be regarded from the point of view of provisioning our troops,
or with regard to the financially remunerative character of the
colony, but because a much more serious question lies behind
it, namely, what significance has the railway in the event of
complications between Germany and other nations? Yes,
this railway can be employed for other purposes than for transport
from the coast to the interior; our troops can be easily
conveyed by it from the interior to the coast and thence to
other places. If, for example, a war had broken out with
England we could send them into Cape Colony.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>From Aus the line was extended in 1908 to Keetmanshoop,
a distance inland of 230 miles from Lüderitzbucht.
Situate in the <i>Bezirk</i> (district) of South-West Africa nearest
to Cape Province, Keetmanshoop, with the railway as a
source of supply from the chief harbour of the colony,
developed into the leading military station of German
South-West Africa.</p>

<p>At Keetmanshoop all the chief military authorities were
stationed. It became the headquarters of the Medical
Corps, the Ordnance Department, the Engineer and Railway
Corps, and the Intelligence Corps of the Southern
Command. It was the point of mobilisation for all the
troops in that Command. It had a considerable garrison,
and it had, also, an arsenal which a correspondent of the
<i>Transvaal Chronicle</i>, who visited the town about two years
before the outbreak of war in 1914 and gathered much
information concerning the military preparations which
had then already been made,<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> described as four times as large,
and, in regard to its contents, four times as important, as
the arsenal at Windhoek. Those contents included&mdash;47
gun carriages; fourteen 16-pounders; eighteen ambulances;
82 covered convoy vehicles; 3,287 wheels, mostly
for trek ox-wagons; three large transportable marquees
used as magazines and containing 28,000 military rifles;
huge quantities of bandoliers, kits, etc.; three further
magazines for ammunition, and large stores of fodder;
while further military supplies were constantly arriving
by train from Lüderitzbucht, whither they were brought
from Germany by German ships. In the arsenal workshops
was a staff of men actively engaged on the making of,
among other military requirements, 1,000 saddles and
water bags for the Camel Corps kept available for crossing
the desert between the furthest limit of the railway and the
Cape Province border.</p>

<p>It was, also, in this south-eastern district, and in immediate
proximity, therefore, to Cape Province and Bechuanaland,
that the military forces kept in the colony had all
their principal man&oelig;uvres.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>
<p>Of still greater importance, from a strategical standpoint,
was the branch of this Southern Railway which,
starting from Seeheim, forty miles west of Keetmanshoop,
continued in a south-easterly direction to Kalkfontein,
eighty miles north of Raman's Drift, on the Orange River,
and less than ninety miles from Ukamas, where the Germans
had established a military post within five miles of Nakob,
situate on the Bechuanaland border, only forty miles
from Upington, in Cape Province. From Kalkfontein
the branch was to be continued another thirty miles to
Warmbad, and so on to Raman's Drift&mdash;a convenient point
for the passage of the Orange River into Cape Province
territory by an attacking force. At Seeheim, the junction
of this branch line, a Service Corps was stationed; Kalkfontein
was the headquarters of the Camel Corps of 500
men and animals; and at Warmbad there was a military
post and a military hospital.</p>

<p>The North-to-South line allowed of an easy movement
of troops between the military headquarters at Keetmanshoop
and Windhoek, or vice versâ. According to the
original estimates this line was not to be completed before
1913. Special reasons for urgency&mdash;as to the nature of
which it would be easy to speculate&mdash;led, however, to the
line being opened for traffic on March 8, 1912. From
Windhoek, also, troops were supplied to Gobabis, situate
100 miles east of the capital and about forty miles west of
the Bechuanaland frontier. Gobabis became a German
military station in 1895. Provided with a well-equipped
fort, it became the chief strategical position on the eastern
border of German South-West Africa. A railway connecting
Gobabis with Windhoek was to have been commenced
in 1915.</p>

<p>From Windhoek, as already told, there is rail communication
with Swakopmund.</p>

<p>Grootfontein, the terminus, on the east, of the Swakopmund-Otavi
line, had been a military station since 1899.
Its special significance lay in the fact that it was the nearest
point of approach by rail to the "Caprivi Strip," along
which the German troops, conveyed as far as Grootfontein<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
by rail, were to make their invasion of the adjoining British
territory of Rhodesia. Troop movements in this direction
would have been further facilitated by a link at Karibib
connecting the Swakopmund-Otavi-Grootfontein line with
the one to Windhoek and thence to the military headquarters
at Keetmanshoop. Karibib was itself a military
base, in addition to having large railway offices and workshops.</p>

<p>With, therefore, the minor exceptions, the system of
railways in German South-West Africa had been designed
or developed in accordance with plans which had for their
basis an eventual attack on British territory in three separate
directions&mdash;(1) Cape Province, (2) Bechuanaland and
(3) Rhodesia. The Southern and the North-to-South lines
had, also, been built exclusively with the standard Cape
gauge of 3 ft. 6 in., so that, when "der Tag" arrived, and
German succeeded British supremacy in South Africa,
these particular lines could be continued in order to link
up with those which the Germans would then expect to take
over from Cape Province. Keetmanshoop was eventually
to be converted from a terminus to a stopping-place on a
through line of German railway from Lüderitzbucht to
Kimberley, the effect of which, it was pointed out, would
be to shorten the distance from Europe to Bulawayo by
1,300 miles as compared with the journey via the Cape.
Surveys had been made for extensions (1) from Keetmanshoop,
via Hasuur, to the Union frontier near Rietfontein,
and (2) from Kalkfontein, on the southern branch, to
Ukamas, also on the frontier and in the direction of Upington,
in Union territory. Each of these additions would
have carried the original scheme a stage further, though
it was not, apparently, thought wise to make them before
"der Tag" actually arrived.</p>

<p>On these various railways the Government of German
South-West Africa had expended, so far as the available
figures show, a total of, approximately, £8,400,000, defrayed
in part from Imperial funds and in part from the revenue
of the Protectorate. This total includes the amount paid
by the Government to the South-West Africa Company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
for their line from Swakopmund to the Company's mines
at Otavi and Tsumeb, but it does not include the cost of
the original narrow-gauge Government line from Swakopmund
to Windhoek, of which the section between Swakopmund
and Karibib was abandoned when the Swakopmund-Otavi
line, via Karibib, was taken over, the remaining section
from Karibib to Windhoek being then converted into the
Cape 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. On most of the open lines no more
than two or three trains a week were run, and on some of
the branches there was only one train in the week.<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Military Preparations</span></h3>

<p>Further details as to the elaborate nature of the preparations
made for the realisation of Germany's dreams of conquest
in Africa are supplied by Mr. J. K. O'Connor in a
pamphlet published at Capetown, towards the end of 1914,
under the title of "The Hun in our Hinterland; or the
Menace of G.S.W.A." Mr. O'Connor made a tour through
German South-West Africa a few months before the outbreak
of the war, assuming the rôle of a journalist in search
of data concerning the agricultural resources of the territory.
He obtained much information which had other
than an agricultural interest.</p>

<p>He ascertained, for instance, that the German troops
then in the territory consisted of Mounted Infantry, Field
Artillery, Machine Gun Divisions, Intelligence Divisions,
an Engineer and Railway Corps, Field Railway Divisions,
an Etappen-Formation, a Camel Corps, a Police Force
and a Reserve, representing altogether&mdash;apart from natives&mdash;a
trained European force of approximately 10,000 men,
whose duties and location in the event of war had all been
assigned to them in advance.</p>

<p>He found that the railways had been supplemented by
a strong transport service of natives, who had an abundant
supply of oxen and mules for their wagons.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>
<p>He tells how (in addition to the military stations already
mentioned) the Germans had established throughout the
territory a network of block-houses, strengthened by forts
at intervals and supplemented by magazines and storehouses
at central points; while 1,600 miles of telegraph
and telephone wires, together with the "Funken-telegraph,"
placed all these stations and outposts in touch with one
another as well as with the military headquarters and the
various towns.<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>He says concerning Keetmanshoop that its conversion
into the chief military station in the territory was "the
first move in the German game."</p>

<p>He points to the fact that "<span xml:lang="de">Das Koloniale Jahrbuch</span>,"
published by authority, laid it down that the Boers in
British South Africa must be constantly reminded of their
Low-German origin; that German ideas must be spread
among them by means of German schools and German
churches, and he declares:&mdash;"For thirty years Teuton
ideas have been foisted upon the Boer population of British
South Africa. For thirty years, under the guise of friendship,
Germany has plotted and planned for the elimination
of the Anglo-Saxon element from South Africa."</p>

<p>Mr. O'Connor further writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From what I was able to gather it was evident that the military
plans of the Germans were completed for an invasion of the
Union territory, and that they were only awaiting the day when
Peace would spread her wings and soar from the embassies of
Europe. It was not anticipated, however, that that would
be in August, 1914.</p>

<p>They were confident of success, and from the conversations
that took place between officers and myself it was evident that
the possession of the African continent was the greatest desire
of the Teutons.</p>

<p>The smashing up of France and Great Britain were only incidents
that would lead to the whole continent of Africa becoming
a German possession; and it was considered that as Germany
would accomplish this, despite her late entrance upon the stage
as a Colonial Power, she would have more to show for her thirty
years as such a Power than could either England or France,
who had started colonising centuries before her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>The great aim became to break France and England, for the
purpose of acquiring their African possessions; and, having
broken these Powers, Germany would have turned her attention
to the African possessions of smaller Powers who, having
neither England nor France to rely upon, would have been
compelled to relinquish their possessions, and, by so doing,
would have made Germany the supreme Power in Africa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Summing up the conclusions at which he arrived, as the
result of all that he saw for himself and all that he had
heard from responsible German officers during the course
of his tour, Mr. O'Connor says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From the day the Germans set their feet upon South-West
African soil they have prepared themselves for a raid into
British territory. For years the Reichstag has voted two
million pounds per annum for the purpose. Had these millions
been spent on the development of South-West Africa
it would, to-day, be a colony of which any country might
be proud. But what can they show for this expenditure?
Nothing but a military camp.</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that this territory has not been regarded
by the Berliners as a colony, but as a jumping-off ground for
an invasion of British South Africa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we have simply an amplification of ideas which,
as we have seen, had long been entertained in Germany;
though they were ideas it was now being sought to reduce
to practice by a resort, in advance, to every step that could
possibly be taken for ensuring their realisation. Any
suggestion that the system of strategical railways which
had been built, and the elaborate military preparations
which had been effected, were merely precautions against
a further possible rising of the natives would have been
absurd.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rail Connection with Angola</span></h3>

<p>What Mr. O'Connor says in regard to Germany's attitude
towards the African possessions of the smaller Powers gives
additional significance to a report published in the <i xml:lang="de">Leipziger
Neueste Nachrichten</i> of May 31, 1914, concerning a
project for building a line of railway along the coast of
German South-West Africa to connect with Portuguese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Angola. This was to be the first of a series of lines which
"after lengthy discussions with the Imperial Government,"
were to be carried out in German South-West Africa by a
syndicate of prominent shipping and banking houses in
Germany, controlling an initial capital of 50,000,000 marks
(£2,500,000). It was further reported that in the early
part of 1914 the Governor of German South-West Africa
made a tour through the northern part of the Protectorate,
going as far as Tiger Bay, in Angola, "in connection with
possible railway construction in the near future."</p>

<p>Angola was certainly an item on the German list of desirable
acquisitions in Africa. It has been in the occupation
of Portugal since the middle of the fifteenth century; but
the point of view from which it was regarded by advocates
of German expansion may be judged from some remarks
made in the <i xml:lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</i> by a traveller who returned
to Germany from Angola in June, 1914:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The game is worth the candle. An enormous market for
industrial products, rich and virgin mineral treasures, a fruitful
and healthy country equally suitable for agriculture, cattle-breeding
and immigration, and the finest harbours on the west
coast&mdash;that is the prize that awaits us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A territory offering these advantages, having an area
estimated at 484,000 square miles, and extending inland
for a distance of 1,500 miles, might be coveted for its own
sake; but its possession would have been of still greater
value to Germany (1) as a continuation, northwards, of
German South-West Africa, and (2) as the starting point
for a chain of communications, under German control,
extending right across the African continent, from west
to east.</p>

<p>The coast-railway spoken of by the <i xml:lang="de">Leipziger Neueste
Nachrichten</i> was to link up German South-West Africa with
Angola, in which country, also, the Germans hoped to
obtain extensive mining and agricultural concessions, thus
forwarding their established policy of peaceful penetration
by means of commerce and railways, and establishing
economic interests which might be expected to lead to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
political developments in due course, and so prepare the
way for an eventual seizure of "the prize that awaits us."</p>

<p>The Germans had also sought to finance the completion
eastwards of the Lobito Bay or Benguela Railway, to which
reference will be made later on in connection with the
development of the Katanga district of the Belgian Congo;
but the condition they advanced, namely that the control
of the line should be left in their hands, coupled with their
adoption of suspicious lines of policy in other directions,<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
led to their railway proposals being declined by the Portuguese,
with thanks.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">German East Africa</span></h3>

<p>Then, in order to understand the full scope of the aspirations
Germany was cherishing towards the African Continent,
one must take into account her railways on the east coast
no less than those on the west coast, since these, also,
formed an essential part of the general scheme.</p>

<p>The line which stretches right across German East Africa,
from Dar-es-Salaam, the capital of the Protectorate, to
Kigoma, on Lake Tanganyika, and north of Ujiji, has a
total length of 1,439 miles; and if the economic development
of a territory estimated as having a total area of
384,000 square miles had been the sole aim in view, the
Tanganyikabahn would have well deserved to rank as a notable
enterprise in German colonial expansion, and one calling
for commendation rather than criticism. The question
arises, however, whether, in addition to the development of
German East Africa itself, the railway in question was not
intended, also, to facilitate the realisation of Germany's
designs against Central Africa as part of her aforesaid
scheme for the eventual conquest of the African continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>The feverish haste with which the second and third
sections of the railway were built sufficed, in itself, to give
rise to suspicions of ulterior designs. The first section,
from Dar-es-Salaam to Morogo (136&frac12; miles), was constructed
by a syndicate of German bankers acting under a State
guarantee of interest, and the work, begun in February, 1905,
was completed in September, 1907. The second section,
from Morogo to Tabora (526&frac12; miles), was to have been
completed by July 1, 1914; but in 1910, the Reichstag
voted a special credit both for the earlier completion of this
second section&mdash;which was thus finished by February 26,
1912&mdash;and for surveys for the third section, from Tabora
to Kigoma (776 miles). Such, again, was the celerity with
which the work on this third section was pushed forward
that, although the date fixed for the completion of the line
was April 1, 1915, through rail communication from the
Indian Ocean to Lake Tanganyika was established by
February 1, 1914&mdash;that is to say, one year and two months
in advance of time.</p>

<p>We here come to the two-fold question (1) Why was the
railway extended at all for the 776 miles from Tabora to
Lake Tanganyika, considering that this portion of the
German Protectorate offered, in itself, the prospect of no
traffic at all for the line<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>; and (2) why was it necessary
that such haste should be shown in the completion of the
undertaking?</p>


<h3>"<span class="smcap">The Other Side of Tanganyika</span>"</h3>

<p>To the first of these questions the reply is (1) that the
traffic on which the western section of the Tanganyikabahn
was mainly to rely for its receipts was traffic originating in
or destined for the Belgian Congo; (2) that the control it
was hoped to secure over Belgian trade was, in combination
with the strategical advantages offered by the railway, to
be the preliminary to an eventual annexation by Germany
of the Belgian Congo itself; and (3) that like conditions
were to lead, if possible, to the final realisation of von
Weber's dream of 1880.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>
<p>"That we are directing our gaze to the other side of Tanganyika,"
said the <i xml:lang="de">Kolonial Zeitung</i> of April 4, 1914, in
referring to the completion of the railway to Kigoma&mdash;an
event which occasioned a great outburst of enthusiasm in
Germany&mdash;"goes, of course, without saying."</p>

<p>There certainly is much on "the other side of Tanganyika"
to which Germany might look with feelings of envy.
In regard to mineral wealth, alone, the resources of the
South-eastern section of the Belgian Congo could not fail
to make a strong appeal to her.</p>

<p>The great copper belt in the Katanga district,<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> commences
about 100 miles north-west of the British South
African post, Ndola (situate twelve miles south of the
Congo border), and extends thence, in a north-westerly
direction, for a distance of 180 miles, with an average
breadth of twenty-five miles. "In the not far distant
future, when the many problems of development are solved,
the Katanga copper belt," says Mr. J. B. Thornhill,<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> "will
be one of the controlling factors in the copper supply of the
world." In the report of the British South Africa Company
for the year ending March 31, 1914, it was stated
that the copper-mining industry in Katanga had attained
to considerable dimensions; that furnaces with a capacity
of 1,000 tons of copper per month were at work, and that
further large additions to the plant were being made.</p>

<p>Katanga has, also, a tin belt, and coal, gold, iron and
other minerals are found there, besides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>In the German territory on the eastern side of Lake
Tanganyika there are, indeed, minerals; but they are
found in no such abundance as in the Belgian territory on
the western side of the lake. German East Africa can,
however, produce in great abundance the wheat, the rice
and the other food supplies necessary for the workers in
Katanga mines, and the German view has been that the
eastern and the western sides of the lake should be regarded
as complementary the one to the other, and that the Tanganyikabahn
should convey these food supplies to the lake,
for transfer to the other side by steamer, and bring back
the products of the mines for distribution, via the German
east coast route and the Indian Ocean, among the markets
of the world. In the same way it was hoped that all goods
and necessaries likely to be imported into the Katanga
and Mweru districts from Europe would reach their destination
via this German East Africa Central Railway; and
German business houses were strongly advised to establish
branches in those districts,<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> so that, apparently, Germany
would eventually control the trade as well as the transport
of "the other side of Tanganyika."</p>

<p>The development of the south-western section of Germany's
east-coast Protectorate had, in itself, become a
matter of vital importance ("<span xml:lang="de">eine Lebensfrage</span>"<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>); but
the Belgian Congo was the only quarter to which that section
could look for markets for its produce. The possibility
of securing sufficient traffic for the Central Railway to ensure
its financial success may have been a secondary consideration;
but the railway itself was to serve a most important
purpose, economically, by helping Germany to capture
the Tanganyika and trans-Tanganyika trade, and by making
her East Africa colony more prosperous; politically,
by strengthening her hold on the Belgian Congo through
the increase of her commercial interests there; and
strategically, by affording her the means of effecting a
speedy concentration of troops in Central Africa, should
the occasion for so doing arise.</p>

<p>This last-mentioned purpose was to be further attained
by the projected construction of what would have been a
purely strategical line from Tabora, on the Tanganyikabahn,
to Mwanza, on the southern shores of the Victoria
Nyanza, whence German troops would&mdash;in case of need&mdash;be
in a position to make a rear attack on British East Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Central Africa</span></h3>

<p>Germany's hopes of thus strengthening her position in
Central Africa by means of the Tanganyikabahn received,
however, a serious set-back through the activity and enterprise
of Belgian and British interests in providing, opening
up or projecting alternative transport routes which
threatened (1) to divert a large proportion of the traffic she
had expected to secure for the East Africa Central line; (2) to
diminish greatly the prospect of her achieving the commercial
and political aims she cherished in regard to the Belgian
Congo; (3) to make it still more difficult for German East
Africa to emerge from a position of comparative isolation,
and (4) to impede greatly the realisation of Germany's
aspirations in regard alike to Central Africa and the African
Continent.</p>

<p>It is the more necessary that the bearing of all these
facts on the general situation should be understood because
they tend to indicate the critical nature of the position into
which the said aspirations had drifted, and the imperative
necessity by which Germany may, by 1914, have considered
she was faced for adopting some bold course of action if she
were still to look forward to the possibility of those aspirations
being realised.</p>

<p>The principle originally adopted by King Leopold in his
efforts to develop the Congo State was that of supplementing
navigation on the Congo by railways wherever these
were necessary either to overcome the difficulties presented
by rapids or to supply missing links in the chain of communication
to or from the west coast. The same policy
was followed by the Belgian Government when they assumed
control, and the last of these links&mdash;the line, 165 miles long,
from Kabalo to Albertville, connecting the Congo with the
Tanganyika&mdash;was opened in March, 1915. One reason, in
fact, given in Germany for the express speed at which the
Tanganyikabahn was completed to Kigoma was an alleged
fear that the Belgians might capture the trade and transport
of the territory in question by getting to the lake first.</p>

<p>This combined river and rail transport still left it necessary
for traffic from the Congo basin to the west coast to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
follow the winding course of that river, with a number of
transhipments; and if the route in question had been the
only competitor of the Tanganyikabahn, Germany would
have had less cause for uneasiness. Meanwhile, however,
the <span xml:lang="fr">Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Bas-Congo</span> had built
a line&mdash;forming a continuation of the Rhodesian Railways&mdash;from
the boundary of Northern Rhodesia, at Elizabethville,
to Kambove (Katanga); and a continuation of this
line to Bukama, on the Lualaba, a navigable tributary of
the Congo, was (1) to give shorter and better access to the
Congo for products from Katanga, and (2) to establish
combined rail and water transport between the entire railway
system of South Africa and the mouth of the Congo.
Already the minerals from Katanga were finding their outlet
to the sea on the east coast via the Rhodesian Railways
and the Portuguese port of Beira, instead of via the Tanganyikabahn
and the German port of Dar-es-Salaam. The
former had, indeed, become the recognised route for this important
traffic in preference to the latter. The line between
Kambove and Bukama had not been completed when war
broke out in 1914; but the provision of this through route,
and the various facilities it would offer, rendered still more
uncertain the prospect of Germany getting control of the
trans-Tanganyika traffic for her own lines.</p>

<p>There were other important railway schemes, besides.</p>

<p>From Bukama rail communication is to be continued
right across Central Africa to Matadi, to which point the
Congo is navigable for large vessels from its mouth, less
than a hundred miles distant. This line, in addition to
avoiding the great bend of the Congo, will open up and
develop the vast and promising territory in the northern
districts of the Belgian Congo, south of that river.</p>

<p>Another scheme which is to be carried out is a line from
Kambove, in the Southern Katanga, to the south-western
boundary of the Belgian Congo, and thence across Portuguese
territory to the present eastern terminus of the Lobito
Bay Railway. This will give to the mining interests of
Katanga direct rail communication, by the shortest possible
route, with a port on the west coast, while the connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
at Kambove with the Rhodesian and South African systems
will make the line a still more important addition to
the railways of Africa for the purposes alike of development
in the central districts and as a shorter route to and from
Europe. German financiers were at one time desirous of
undertaking the extension eastward of the Lobito Bay
Railway&mdash;mainly, as it seemed, with a view to furthering
German interests in Portuguese territory (see page <a href="#Page_314">314</a>);
but the Kambove-Lobito Bay line is now to be constructed
with British capital.</p>

<p>Finally there is the Cape-to-Cairo Railway which, passing
through the Katanga mining districts, is likely to divert
still more of the traffic Germany had counted upon alike
for her Tanganyikabahn and as a means towards the attainment
of her political aspirations in Central Africa.</p>

<p>Whilst these various developments were proceeding,
there were still others, in the Cameroons, to which attention
may now be directed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Cameroons, Lake Chad and the Sudan</span></h3>

<p>Anticipations of the great results for Germany which
would follow from the building of railways in the Cameroons
began to be entertained about the year 1897. The main
objective of the schemes brought forward seems to have
been, however, not simply the internal economic development
of an already vast area, but the carrying of lines of
communication to the furthest limits of that area in order,
apparently, to extend German interests and influence to
territories beyond.</p>

<p>One of these schemes was for the building of a line of
railway from Duala, the chief port of the Cameroons, to
Lake Chad (otherwise Tsâd), a sheet of water some 7,000
square miles in extent which, situate on the western borders
of the Sudan, constitutes the extreme northern limits of
German territory in this direction, while the shores of the
lake are occupied jointly by Germany, England and France.</p>

<p>The proposed line was to have an estimated total length
of about 1,000 kilometres (621 miles). In September, 1902,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the German Imperial Government granted to a <span xml:lang="de">Kamerun-Eisenbahn-Syndikat</span>
a concession for building the line;
an expedition sent out by the syndicate made a survey of
the route in 1902-3; and a <span xml:lang="de">Kamerun-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft</span>,
with a capital of 17,000,000 marks (£850,000), was
formed by a group of bankers and others in Germany to
build the first section.</p>

<p>In December, 1903, the German Emperor, at his reception
of the President of the Reichstag, gave his blessing to
all such enterprises by declaring that an essential condition
("<span xml:lang="de">eine Lebensbedingung</span>") for the welfare of Germany's
colonies in Africa was that the building of railways should
be taken earnestly in hand. In 1905 the prospects of the
proposed line seemed so hopeful that the early commencement
of construction was announced as probable; but
various difficulties arose, including much trouble in regard
to labour, and the line did not get beyond the end of its
first stage, a distance of only 160 km. (100 miles) from the
coast.</p>

<p>Although the scheme was thus not fully carried out,
there was no doubt as to the nature of the purposes it had
been designed to serve. In his official and detailed account
of the proposed undertaking<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>&mdash;a book of exceptional
merit from the point of view of the clearness and of the
exhaustive data with which "the case for the line" is
presented&mdash;the director of the syndicate says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My opinion is that only a great railway&mdash;one that unites the
Sudan with the Atlantic, and that extends from Lake Chad
to the west coast of Africa&mdash;will be in a position both to develop
fully the economic interests of the Cameroons and to assure
to Germany a means of access to the richest territory that Central
Africa possesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>
<p>Had the line been completed as far as Lake Chad, it
would have been a powerful competitor of British railways
via the Nile or the Red Sea for the traffic of the Sudan,
with its vast commercial possibilities; and, had it been found
the better route, it might have established German commercial
supremacy in this part of Central Africa, with the
inevitable political developments to follow. "The German
<span xml:lang="de">Tsâdsee-Eisenbahn</span>," the director of the syndicate
further wrote, "will, especially when it has been completed,
be for the whole of Central Africa a <i xml:lang="de">Kulturwerk</i> of the first
importance."</p>

<p>The Germanisation of Lake Chad, combined with an
eventual acquiring by Germany of French interests in the
Sahara and North Africa, would further have permitted
the continuation of the <span xml:lang="de">Tsâdsee-Eisenbahn</span> from that lake
to Algeria along the route already projected in France for
a Trans-African line linking up the Mediterranean alike
with the Congo and with the Rhodesian and other British
railways in South Africa, via Lake Chad&mdash;a line which, it
is said, would offer no great technical difficulty in construction.<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Cameroons and the Congo</span></h3>

<p>Another ambitious scheme was for the building of a
Mittellandbahn which, crossing the Njong, would eventually
link up the chief port of the Cameroons with a navigable
tributary of the Congo. Here, again, the line as
actually constructed has not been carried a greater distance
than about 300 km. (186 miles). At one time, in fact, the
original project seemed to have been abandoned; but quite
recently it has been brought forward again under conditions
which have a distinct bearing on what has already been said
concerning Germany and Central Africa.</p>

<p>From the views expressed by Emil Zimmermann in his
"<span xml:lang="de">Neu-Kamerun</span>,"<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> one gathers that in 1913 Germany was
regarding with some degree of concern alike the outlook
for her Tanganyikabahn, on which over £7,000,000 had been
spent, and the prospective set-back to her aspirations in
regard to the Belgian Congo; and Herr Zimmermann, in
giving an account of the additions made to her Cameroons
possessions at the expense of France, under the agreement
of November 4, 1911, following on the Agadir crisis, makes
certain overtures to Belgium, and follows them up with a
distinct threat, should she refrain from responding to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Belgium and Germany, he says, in effect, are the two
dominant Powers in Central Africa; and he is of opinion
that it will be to their mutual interest to co-operate in the
development of that great territory. Belgium, however, he
finds to be faced by the need for a great outlay of money
(1) on account of necessary improvements of her Congo rail
and river communication, to meet expanding traffic requirements,
and (2) in order to develop her Katanga territory.
She cannot herself command the necessary capital, but
Germany could assist her to raise it, and would do so&mdash;provided
Belgium undertook that traffic from her Tanganyika
and Mweru districts, and, also, from points east of the
Middle Congo, should reach the sea by "its natural outlet,"
that is to say, by the German East African Central Railway.</p>

<p>Should Belgium refuse to agree to these proposals, and
should she, by her high tariffs, continue to impede the flow
of traffic to German territory, then it would be open to
Germany to construct lines of railway from the west coast
either to navigable tributaries of the Congo or to the Congo
itself, and so divert the traffic from the Belgian Congo at
certain important points, to the serious prejudice of Belgian
interests.</p>

<p>Apart from what might be done in the way of extending
the Duala-Njong line to the said navigable tributaries of
the Congo, as originally projected, Herr Zimmermann says
that, under the treaty of November 4, 1911, Germany has
the right to continue her Cameroons railways across French
territory (France having reciprocal rights as regards German
territory); and he points out how she could exercise
this power, to the detriment of Belgium, should that country
not accept her proposals in regard to the Congo basin and
Central Africa. He specially mentions the fact that when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the boundaries of the 100,000 square miles of territory
added, at the expense of France, to the German Cameroons
(then already 191,000 square miles in extent), were fixed
by virtue of the treaty of 1911, the wedge-like strip on
the south of Spanish Muni was so defined as to leave at the
eastern point thereof a gap between the Spanish territory
and the French Cameroons wide enough for either a road
or a railway; and he emphasises the fact that, by taking
advantage of the facilities thus open to her, Germany could,
under the treaty of 1911, construct a railway 1,000 km.
(621 miles) long from Muni Bay through the said gap and
cross French territory to the junction of the Sangha with
the Congo. Alternatively, and by arrangement with France,
the line could start from Libreville. "What such a railway,
tapping the Congo-Sangha-Ubangi traffic at its most
favourable point, would mean, can," Herr Zimmermann
remarks, "be left to the Belgians themselves to say."</p>

<p>He does not suggest that such schemes as these would
in themselves be of great value to Germany; but he thinks
they might have a powerful influence, both politically and
economically, on the solution of the Tanganyika problem
in Germany's favour. In fact, he considers that since the
1911 treaty Germany has practically controlled the situation
in Central Africa; and from all he says it is a reasonable
assumption that the Agadir crisis, the concession of territory
exacted from France, and the undertaking as to the carrying
of German Cameroon railways across French territory, had
far more to do with German designs on the Belgian Congo
and Central Africa than is generally supposed.</p>

<p>In another work, published a year later,<a id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> the same writer,
adopting now a distinctly different tone, endeavoured to
appease an "Anti-Central Africa agitation" which, he
tells us, had developed in Germany and was protesting alike
against the "danger" of acquiring any more "Congo-swamps"
and against the "boundless German plans" in
Africa. He further sought to soothe the suspicions which,
he found, had been excited in Belgium and elsewhere as
to the nature of Germany's plans in Africa. Germany,
he declared, had no annexation projects in view. Her aspirations
were purely economic. Kamerun, thanks to the
German-French treaty of 1911 (which, he reiterated, had
changed the whole situation), could now take a considerable
share in the development of Central Africa, and was the
more entitled so to do since she had, in Duala, "one of the
best harbours on the west coast of Africa."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Official Admissions</span></h3>

<p>As against, however, affirmations such as these, there
is the undisputable evidence of no less an authority than
the German Foreign Minister himself as to the real nature
of Germany's designs on the Belgian Congo.</p>

<p>In the second Belgian Grey Book, published in August,
1915, under the title of "<span xml:lang="fr">Correspondance Diplomatique
relative à la Guerre de 1914-15</span>," there is given (pp. 2-3) a
letter from the Belgian Minister in Berlin, Baron Beyens,
to his Government, recording, under date April 2, 1914, a
conversation which the French Ambassador in Berlin informed
him he had had quite recently (and, therefore, only
about four months before the outbreak of war) with the
German Foreign Minister. Herr von Jagow suggested to
him that Germany, France and England should arrive at
an agreement on the construction and linking up of railways
in Africa. M. Gambon replied that in this case Belgium
ought to be invited to confer with them, as she was
constructing some new railways on the Congo. He also
expressed the view that any conference held on the subject
should meet at Brussels. To this Herr von Jagow responded,
"Oh no; for it is at the expense of Belgium that
our agreement should be made. Do you not think," he
added, "that King Leopold placed too heavy a burden on
the shoulders of Belgium? Belgium is not rich enough to
develop that vast possession. It is an enterprise beyond
her financial resources and her means of expansion." The
French Ambassador dissented, but Herr von Jagow went
on to affirm that the great Powers were alone in a position
to colonise, and that the small Powers were destined to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
disappear or to gravitate towards the orbit of the large
ones. In the words of the Belgian Minister:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span xml:lang="fr">Il développa l'opinion que seules les grandes Puissances sont
en situation de coloniser. Il dévoila même le fond de sa pensée
en soutenant que les petits États ne pourraient plus mener,
dans la transformation qui s'opérait en Europe au profit des
nationalités les plus fortes, par suite du développement des forces
économiques et des moyens de communication, l'existence
indépendante dont ils avaient joui jusqu'à présent. Ils étaient
destinés à disparaître ou à graviter dans l'orbite des grandes
Puissances.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">"<span xml:lang="de">Der Tag</span>" and its Programme</span></h3>

<p>The story here presented of Germany's aims in Africa
has taken us over almost the entire African Continent. It
now only remains to be seen how those aims were to be
realised, not merely as the outcome of Pan-German dreams
and advocacy, but as the result of many years of scheming,
plotting and actual preparation, all directed to the wiping
out of the influence in Africa of other Powers, great as well
as small, and the final realisation of Germany's long-cherished
purpose.</p>

<p>According to conversations Mr. O'Connor had with
military officers in German South-West Africa just before
the outbreak of war in 1914, the programme under which
Germany hoped to become "the supreme power in Africa"
when "<span xml:lang="de">der Tag</span>" so long looked forward to should arrive
was, in effect, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Belgium was to be disposed of "at one gulp." This
would make it an easy matter for Germany to take over
the Belgian Congo.</p>

<p>France would be paralysed; and, being paralysed, she
would not be able to prevent Germany from succeeding to
the whole of her possessions in Africa.</p>

<p>The Dervishes would stir up a rebellion in Egypt,<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and
other rebellions were anticipated in Ireland and India.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>
<p>While England was fully occupied in these directions the
Afrikanders were to rise <i>en masse</i> and declare British South
Africa an Afrikander Republic.</p>

<p>The forces in German East Africa would make a sudden
raid into British East Africa. Having annexed that territory
and got possession of the railway, they would next
invade Rhodesia from the east, in co-operation with troops
from German South-West Africa advancing to the Zambezi,
via the Caprivi Strip, from the railway terminus at Grootfontein.</p>

<p>Meanwhile German columns would have moved (1) from
the military station at Gobabis into Bechuanaland, crossing
the desert of Kalahari, to effect the capture of Vryburg;
and (2) from Keetmanshoop, and other points served by
the Seeheim branch, into northern Cape Province, via
Raman's Drift, Schuit Drift and the south-east corner of
the territory.</p>

<p>Rhodesia having been seized, more troops would be
available to proceed to the assistance of the Afrikander
forces operating in the Cape Province, the Transvaal and
the Orange Free State&mdash;a "rising" on the part of the
Afrikanders as soon as they saw a good opportunity for
one being taken for granted. In return for the services
thus rendered by her to the Afrikanders in establishing their
Republic, Germany would take a portion of the Transvaal,
as well as part of the Zululand coast.</p>

<p>With Belgium and France effectively crushed, and the
power of Great Britain in South Africa broken down, those
countries would no longer be in a position to prevent Germany
from annexing Portuguese Angola; and this she
was to do next. She would "allow" the Afrikander Republic
to take Delagoa Bay; but the Republic itself was
to come under the "guardianship" of Germany. The
word "suzerainty," Mr. O'Connor says, was not mentioned,
"guardianship" being preferred; but, with the exception
of Italian Somaliland&mdash;about which nothing was said&mdash;practically
the whole of Africa was either to belong to
Germany or to be brought directly or indirectly under
her control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Objective of the World-War</span></h3>

<p>Since the outbreak of the World-War in 1914 there has
been much speculation as to the real objective and purpose
of Germany in bringing it about.</p>

<p>Do the facts stated in the present chapter afford any
help towards a solution of this problem?</p>

<p>We have seen the nature of the aims cherished by Germany
towards Africa, the practical and persistent efforts
she made during a long series of years for their attainment,
and the substantial expenditure she incurred in the hope
of at last securing the prize she considered was awaiting her.</p>

<p>We have seen how the purpose of Germany in Africa
was less to develop colonies for their own sake than to
regard them as points from which to absorb or to control
neighbouring territories.</p>

<p>We have seen how the development of rival railways
in Central Africa had recently threatened the supremacy
Germany hoped to gain and may, indeed, have suggested
to her the need for early vigorous effort, if she wished still
to secure the realisation of her aims.</p>

<p>We have seen what, in the view of the German Foreign
Minister, should be the fate of small Powers which stand
in the way of the aggrandisement of great ones.</p>

<p>We have seen, also, how, in the opinion of officers serving
in German South-West Africa, the real purpose of the war
to which they were looking forward, and for which they
were preparing, was the German annexation of Africa, and
how the "smashing up" of France and Great Britain, the
overthrow of Belgium, the seizure of Portuguese possessions,
and the virtual absorption of the proposed new Boer Republics
were to be the preliminaries to a final transformation
of the whole African Continent into a German possession&mdash;the
"new Empire" which, in the words of von Weber,
was to be "possibly more valuable and more brilliant than
even the Indian Empire."</p>

<p>May one not conclude, in face of these and of all the other
facts which have here been narrated, that one, at least, of
the main objectives of Germany (apart from minor ones) in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
provoking the Great War was no less a prize than the African
Continent;<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and that when she invaded Belgium and France
she did so less with the object of annexing the former country,
and of creating another Alsace-Lorraine in the latter
than of having "something in her hand" with which to
"bargain"&mdash;in the interests of her projects in Africa&mdash;when
the time came for discussing the terms of peace, assuming
that she had not already attained her purpose at the
outset by the sheer force of what she thought would be her
irresistible strength?</p>

<p>If this conclusion should seem to be warranted, on the
basis of what has already been told, it may certainly be
regarded as confirmed by the fact that, down to the moment
when these lines are being written, any suggestions coming
from German sources as to possible terms of peace have
invariably included proposals for the concession to Germany
of territory in Africa as "compensation" for the
surrender of territory she has herself occupied in Belgium
and France.</p>

<p>Thus, in a despatch published in <i>The Times</i> of September
4, 1915, a statement was reproduced from the Chicago
<i>Tribune</i> giving, on the authority of "a writer in close touch
with the German Embassy," the terms on which Germany
would be prepared to agree to peace. These terms included
the following:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>The cession of the Belgian Congo to Germany, as compensation
for the evacuation of Belgium.</p>

<p>The cession of African colonial territory to Germany by
France, as compensation for the evacuation of Northern France.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, also, on October 24, 1915, the <i>New York American</i>
published a long interview with Professor Hans Delbrück
on the terms of peace which Germany hoped to secure if
"President Wilson and the Pope" would consent to act
as mediators. The interview (which had been approved
by the German censor) included the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is quite possible that peace could be secured by ceding to
Germany such colonies as Uganda by England and the French
and Belgian Congos as a ransom for the evacuation by Germany
of Northern France and Belgium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such concessions, if one can conceive the possibility of
their being made&mdash;would still leave Germany far from the
attainment of her full African programme; but the fact of
these proposals being put forward at all as "terms of peace"
is quite in keeping with the whole course of Germany's
policy in Africa, and points clearly to what may, in fact,
have been her chief objective in the war itself.</p>

<p>Any moral reflections either on the said policy or on the
"programme" by means of which it was to have been
carried out would be beyond the scope of the present work.</p>

<p>What we are here concerned in is the fact that Germany's
dreams of an African Empire, given expression to by von
Weber in 1880, and the subject of such continuous effort
ever since, were, in the possibilities of their realisation,
based primarily on the extension and utilisation of such
facilities for rail-transport as she might be able either to
create or to acquire.</p>

at the time of the rising, many of them were armed with Mausers
and Lee-Enfields, it has been said of them that they were not of
much account with the rifle, their "natural weapon" being the
assegai. A German White Book on the rebellion stated that the
cause of the outbreak was the spirit of independence which characterised
the Hereros, "to whom the increasing domination of
the Germans had become insupportable, and who believed themselves
stronger than the whites." According to Mr. H. A. Bryden
("The Conquest of German South-West Africa," <i>Fortnightly Review</i>,
July, 1915) the real causes were the abuses of the white trader,
the brutal methods of certain officials, and the seizure and occupation
of tribal lands. The war developed into one of practical extermination
for the natives concerned. Of the Hereros between
20,000 and 30,000 were either killed outright or driven into the
Kalahari desert to die of starvation. The Hottentots also lost

to furnish Germany with all the elbow room she may require within
the next half-century. Professor Delbrück, while agreeing with
Herr Rohrbach, as to the importance of Central Africa, as well as of
Angola and the whole of British East Africa, further emphasises the
necessity for the acquisition of the Sudan and the southern part of
the Sahara, now in the possession of France. We are quite in
agreement with these eminent leaders that we must found an
"India" of our own, and that the greater part of the African
continent must furnish the requisite territory. Once well established
in this new empire, we shall link ourselves with Asiatic Turkey, and
also with China, reconstructing the political and economic foundations
of both on a scientific German basis."</p></div></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="smcap">Designs on Asiatic Turkey</span></h2>


<p>Just as avowedly strategical lines in Africa were to lead
the way to the creation of a German African Empire, so,
in turn, was that system of economic-political-strategical
lines comprised within the scheme of what is known as the
"Baghdad Railway" designed to ensure the establishment
of a German Middle-Asian Empire, bringing under German
control the entire region from the Mediterranean to the
Persian Gulf, and providing convenient stepping-off places
from which an advance might be made on Egypt in the one
direction and India in the other.</p>

<p>The conception of this further programme was spread
over (1) the period during which Germany's aspirations were
limited to the inheritance of Turkey's possessions in Asia;
and (2) the period when such inheritance began to be regarded
as a means to the realisation of still greater aims in
the domain of <span xml:lang="de">Weltpolitik</span>.</p>

<p>For more than half a century Asiatic Turkey has been
looked upon as Germany's Land of Promise. Anatolia was
thought a most desirable territory for her surplus population.
The development, under German influence, of that territory
as a whole&mdash;especially with a revival of the Babylonian
system of irrigation&mdash;was considered to offer vast possibilities
of commercial prosperity. Wheat, cotton and
tobacco, especially, might be raised in prodigious quantities,
and there was the prospect, also, of a petroleum industry
rivalling that of Baku itself. Turkey was a decadent
nation, and as soon as "the Sick Man" succumbed to his
apparently inevitable fate&mdash;or even before, should circumstances
permit&mdash;Germany was ready to step into his shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>That these aspirations had, indeed, long been cherished
is a fact capable of ready proof.</p>

<p>In 1848 Wilhelm Roscher, the leading expounder of the
historical school of political economy in Germany, selected
Asia Minor as Germany's share in the Turkish spoils, whenever
the division thereof should take place; and Johann
Karl Robertus (1805-1875), the founder of the so-called
scientific socialism in Germany, expressed the hope that he
would live long enough to see Turkey fall into the hands
of Germany, and, also, to see German soldiers on the shores
of the Bosporus.</p>

<p>Coming to a more recent period, we find that Dr. Aloys
Sprenger, the German orientalist, published, in 1886, a
pamphlet on "Babylonia, the richest land in the past, and
the most promising field for colonisation in the present,"<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
in which, after dealing with the history, physical conditions
and resources of Babylonia, he predicted that, before the
end of the century, not only Babylonia but Assyria, which
was inseparable from it, would, if not formally annexed, at
least come under the control of some European Power.
Assyria and Syria, he declared, were even better adapted
for colonisation than Babylonia. He continued:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Orient is the only territory on earth which has not yet
been taken possession of by some aspiring nation. It offers the
finest opportunities for colonisation, and if Germany, taking
care not to let the opportunity slip, should act before the Cossacks
come along, she would, in the division of the world, get
the best share.... The German Kaiser, as soon as a few
hundred thousand armed German colonists bring these promising
fields into cultivation, will have in his hand the fate of Asia
Minor, and he can&mdash;and will&mdash;then become the Protector of
Peace for the whole of Asia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Karl Kaerger, traveller and economist, lamented, in
his "<span xml:lang="de">Kleinasien; ein deutsches Kolonisationsfeld</span>" (Berlin,
1892), the enormous loss sustained by Germany in the
migration of so many of her people and of so much capital
to Anglo-Saxon lands; but there were, he affirmed, only
two countries to which German settlers could go with any
hope of retaining alike their nationality and their commercial
relations with the <i xml:lang="de">Mutterland</i>. Those countries were&mdash;Africa
and Asia Minor. He had been especially impressed,
during the course of his travels, by the prospects and possibilities
of Anatolia, and he recommended the establishment
there of large German companies which would organise
schemes of colonisation and land cultivation on a large scale.
The colonies so established should be self-governing, free
from all taxation for ten years, have the right of duty-free
importation of necessaries, and enjoy various other privileges,
while Turkey, in return for the concessions she thus
made to the settlers, would be assured "the protection of
Germany against attack." Not only hundreds of thousands,
but millions, of colonists could find a second home on those
wide expanses. Germany herself would gain a dual advantage&mdash;an
economical one, and a political one. Concerning
the latter, Dr. Kaerger observed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If the German Empire, while maintaining her friendship
with Austria and Italy&mdash;which, under all circumstances, the
political situation in Europe undoubtedly requires&mdash;can direct
the stream of her emigration to the fertile territories of Turkey,
and if she can conclude with that country a closer customs convention,
then the entire economic, and with it, also, the political
future of Germany will rest on a broader and a firmer basis than
if the present streams of hundreds of thousands of her people,
and millions of capital, continue to pass in increasing proportions,
year by year, to countries which are economically hostile
to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Kaerger was especially concerned lest Germany might
be anticipated by Russia or England in the realisation of
her own designs on Asia Minor. Should, he declared, either
of those countries acquire any further territory from Turkey,
or increase in any way Turkey's dependence upon them,
the result would be the most serious disturbance of the
prevailing situation in Europe that had occurred since 1870.</p>

<p>The development of all these ideas went so far that in
1895 the <i xml:lang="de">Alldeutscher Blätter</i> recommended that Germany
should establish a Protectorate over the Turkish possessions
in Asia Minor; and in the following year the <i xml:lang="de">Alldeutscher</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
<i xml:lang="de">Verband</i> published a manifesto on "German claims to the
Inheritance of Turkey" ("<span xml:lang="de">Deutschlands Anspruch an das
türkische Erbe</span>"), making a formal statement of Germany's
alleged rights to the Turkish succession.</p>

<p>Germany had by this time already secured a footing on
the soil of Asiatic Turkey by virtue of the <i>Anatolian Railway</i>.
The first section&mdash;a length of about seventy miles,
extending from Haidar Pacha (situate on the north-eastern
coast of the Sea of Marmara, and opposite Constantinople)
to Ismidt&mdash;was built in 1875 by German engineers to the
order of the Turkish Government. It was transferred in
1888 to a German syndicate, nominees of the Deutsche
Bank. Under the powers then conferred upon them, the
syndicate opened an extension, on the east, to Angora, in
1892, and another, on the south, to Konia, in 1896, the total
length of line being thus increased to 633 miles.</p>

<p>As the result of the visit of the German Emperor to Constantinople
in 1898, followed by negotiations between the
Porte and the director of the Deutsche Bank, authority was
given to a new German Company&mdash;the Imperial Ottoman
Baghdad Railway Company&mdash;under conventions of 1889,
1902 and 1903, to continue the existing Anatolian Railway
from Konia to the Persian Gulf, via Adana, Nisibin, Mosul
and Baghdad. This extension was to constitute the main
line of the <i>Baghdad Railway</i> proper; but the Company also
acquired control over most of the branch railways already
in operation. One of these was the French Smyrna&mdash;Afium
Karahissar line, which constitutes the direct trade route
between Smyrna and places served by the Anatolian railway,
and has, also, a branch to Panderma, on the southern shores
of the Sea of Marmara. Another was the short line from
Adana to Mersina, giving access to the Mediterranean.
This meant the substitution of German for French interests,
while the course taken by the Anatolia-Baghdad Railway
from the Bosporus to Adana shut off the possibility of an
extension of the British line from Smyrna via Aidin to
Egerdir (west of Konia) into the interior.</p>

<p>Then in 1911 the Company acquired the right to build a
<i>new port at Alexandretta</i>, with quays, docks, bonded warehouses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
etc., and to construct thence a short line of railway
connecting with the Baghdad main line at Osmanieh, east
of Adana. By these means the Germans acquired the
control over, if not an actual monopoly of, the traffic between
one of the most important ports on the eastern sea-board
of the Mediterranean&mdash;a port where a trade valued
at three and a half million sterling is already being done&mdash;and
the vast extent of territory in Asia Minor designed to
be served by the Baghdad Railway.</p>

<p>From Muslimiyeh, a little town on the north of Aleppo,
there is a short branch connecting the Baghdad Railway
with the <i>Hedjaz line</i> from Damascus to Medina, which is
eventually to be carried on to Mecca; while from Rayak,
north of Damascus, a branch built in a south-westerly
direction was to be carried to within a short distance of the
Egyptian frontier.</p>

<p>From the junction for the Aleppo branch, the main line
was to continue across the Mesopotamian plain to Baghdad
(whence a branch to Khanikin, on the Persian frontier was
projected) and so on to Basra, for the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>Thus the scheme for what passes under the title of the
Baghdad Railway embraces three separate and distinct
regions of Asiatic Turkey&mdash;(1) Anatolia, (2) Syria and (3)
Mesopotamia. In other words, whereas in their first phase,
German aspirations for Turkish territory were based on
the economic advantages of settlement in Anatolia&mdash;a
region in itself large enough to accommodate all the Germans
who were likely to want to settle there&mdash;in the
second phase those aspirations were based on an extension
of the Baghdad Railway towards Egypt in the one direction
and the Persian Gulf in the other. This dual extension
became the more noticeable, also, inasmuch as for the passage
of the Taurus range of mountains a total of nearly 100
miles of blasting and tunnelling would have to be carried
out, the cost of construction on certain sections of the line
rising to between £35,000 and £40,000 a mile. The extension,
therefore, was likely to be a costly business, the total
length of the Baghdad Railway proper, apart from the
Anatolian system, being, as projected, about 1,350 miles, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
which, however, only about 600 miles were, in June, 1915,
available for traffic.<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Admitting the desirability of opening
up Mesopotamia to commercial and agricultural development,
it may, nevertheless, be asked, were there other motives&mdash;and
motives to which still greater weight might have been
attached&mdash;for this expansion of the earlier designs?</p>

<p>Abdul Hamid's reason for granting the concession is said
to have been that the extension of the line to the Persian
Gulf would greatly strengthen the military position of
Turkey, since it would enable her to effect a speedy transfer
of troops between the Bosporus and the Gulf, or intermediate
places, as against the many months that might be
occupied by marching on foot across plains and mountains.</p>

<p>Germany's reasons for seeking to construct the Baghdad
Railway, its branches and connections, to the full extent
of the programme laid down, were, not simply the development
of new trade routes, as certain inspired representations
have sought to make the world believe, and not simply the
gain of various other economic advantages, but (1) a desire
to increase German influence over Turkey; to strengthen
her military and other resources with a view to employing
them eventually in the advancement of Germany's own
interests; and to ensure the realisation of that eventual
Protectorate over Turkey which would convert the country
into practically a German province; and (2) the furthering
of Germany's aims against Great Britain in the belief that
she, too, was a decadent country whose possessions, when
we could no longer defend them effectively, Germany would
be the more likely to secure for herself if, with a concentration
of Turkish forces to assist her, she were established
within striking distance of some of the most vulnerable
points of the British Empire, ready to take instant advantage
of any favourable opportunity that might present
itself, whether in a prospective break-up of that Empire
or otherwise.</p>

<p>Of evidence concerning Germany's efforts to obtain
increasing influence over Turkey there is no lack.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>
<p>We have, in the first place, the fact that in 1882 a German
military mission, of which General the Baron Colmar von
der Goltz was the principal member, undertook the training
of the Turkish Army according to the principles of German
military science, with the result that the Turkish Army
became a more efficient instrument for the attainment, not
only of her own aims or purposes, but those, also, of Germany
herself.</p>

<p>The Kaiser, although the supreme head of the Lutheran
Church, and although having no Mohammedan subjects
of his own, sought to pose as the champion of Mohammedans
in general and the Defender of <i>their</i> Faith. During his
visit to Damascus in November, 1898, he declared&mdash;"May
the Sultan, may the three hundred million Mohammedans
living who, scattered throughout the earth, honour in
his person their Caliph, rest assured that at all times the
German Kaiser will be their friend."<a id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Whenever political trouble threatened to fall upon Turkey,
as the result of such occurrences as the Armenian and
Macedonian atrocities or the insurrection in Crete, it was
Germany who became her champion as against the other
Powers of Europe.</p>

<p>Everything possible was done to push German trade in
Turkey and to establish closer commercial relations with
her. There came a time when every city of importance in
the Turkish Empire was declared to be "overrun with
German bankers, German clerks and German bagmen."</p>

<p>Not only, too, were German engineers active in seeking
to get concessions for new railways, and not only were
German financiers equally active in endeavouring to control
existing ones, but, as Dr. Charles Sarolea points out, in his
book on "The Anglo-German Problem," there are, in the
agreements between the Baghdad Railway Company and
the Porte, financial clauses which must ultimately place
Turkey entirely at the mercy of her professed champion.
"In Turkey Germany alone would rule supreme"; and
the aspirations for a German Protectorate over Turkey,
with the Sultan as a vassal of Germany, would then be
realised.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>
<p>Writing on the position as he found it in 1903, M. André
Chéradame said in "<span xml:lang="fr">La Question d'Orient</span>":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>More and more the Germans seem to regard the land of the
Turks as their personal property. All the recent German literature
relating to Turkey affords proof of the tendency. An
ordinary book of travels is entitled, "In Asia Minor, by German
Railways." In his "Pan-Germanic Atlas" Paul Langhams
gives a map of "German Railways in Asia Minor." So
it is, indeed, a matter of the organised conquest of Turkey.
Everywhere and in everything, Turkey is being encircled by
the tentacles of the German octopus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coming, next, to the nature of <i>Germany's aims against
England</i> and the part which the Baghdad Railway was to
play in their attainment, we have the frank confessions of
Dr. Paul Rohrbach, an authority on the subject of Germany's
<span xml:lang="de">Weltpolitik</span>, and a traveller who has paid four visits to Asia
Minor. In "<span xml:lang="de">Die Baghdadbahn</span>" (2nd. edition, 1911) he
tells us that Ludwig Ross, a professor at Halle who was
well acquainted with Anatolia, was the first to point to Asia
Minor as a desirable place for German settlement. At the
outset economic considerations were alone concerned, and
in Bismarck's day Germany's relations to England played
only a minor rôle in her foreign politics; but in proportion
as Germany's interests were developed and her soil no longer
provided sufficient food for her people or sufficient raw
products for her manufactures, she had to look abroad for
the supply of her surplus needs. In so doing, however,
her interests abroad might be endangered by the British
Fleet. Hence the necessity for a German Fleet; and,
although the German sea-power might not be strong enough,
by itself, to attack and conquer England, it could bring
certain considerations home to English policy. Dr. Rohrbach
continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If it came to a matter of war with England, it would be for
Germany simply a question of life and death. The possibility
of a successful issue for Germany depends exclusively on one
consideration, namely, on whether or not we can succeed in
bringing England herself into a dangerous position. That end
can in no way be obtained by means of a direct attack across
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>the North Sea; any idea of a German invasion of England
being possible is a mere phantasy. One must seek, therefore,
another combination in order to assail England at some vulnerable
spot; and here we come to the point where the relations
of Germany to Turkey, and the conditions prevailing in Turkey,
are found to be of decisive importance for German foreign
policy. There is, in fact, only one means possible by which
Germany can resist a war of aggression by England, and that
is the strengthening of Turkey.</p>

<p>England can, from Europe, be attacked by land and mortally
wounded only in one place&mdash;Egypt. If England were to lose
Egypt she would lose, not only her control over the Suez Canal
and her connexions with India and the Far East, but, presumably,
also, her possessions in Central and East Africa. The
conquest of Egypt by a Mohammedan Power, such as Turkey,
might, in addition, have a dangerous effect on her 60,000,000
Mohammedan subjects in India, besides being to her prejudice
in Afghanistan and Persia.</p>

<p>Turkey, however, can never dream of recovering Egypt until
she controls a fully-developed railway system in Asia Minor
and Syria; until, by the extension of the Anatolian Railway
to Baghdad, she can resist an attack by England on Mesopotamia;
until her army has been increased and improved;
and until progress has been made in her general economic
and financial conditions.... The stronger Turkey becomes,
the greater will be the danger for England if, in a German-English
conflict, Turkey should be on the side of Germany;
and, with Egypt for a prize, it certainly would be worth
the while of Turkey to run the risk of fighting with Germany
against England. On the other hand the mere fact that Turkey
had increased in military strength, had improved her economic
position, and had an adequate railway system, would make
England hesitate to attack Germany; and this is the point at
which Germany must aim. The policy of supporting Turkey
which is now being followed by Germany has no other purpose
than that of effecting a strong measure against the danger of
war with England.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From other directions, besides, similar testimony was
forthcoming.</p>

<p>The Socialist <i xml:lang="de">Liepziger Volkszeitung</i> declared in March,
1911, that "the new situation shortly to be created in Asia
Minor would hasten the break-up of the British Empire,
which was already beginning to totter (<span xml:lang="de">schwanken</span>)."</p>

<p>In <i xml:lang="de">Die Neue Zeit</i> for June 2, 1911, Herr Karl Radek said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>The strengthening of German Imperialism, the first success
of which, attained with so much effort, is the Baghdad Railway;
the victory of the revolutionary party in Turkey; the prospect
of a modern revolutionary movement in India, which, of course,
must be regarded as a very different thing from the earlier
scattered risings of individual tribes; the movement towards
nationalisation in Egypt; the beginning of reform in Egypt&mdash;all
this has raised to an extraordinary degree the political
significance of the Baghdad Railway question.</p>

<p>The Baghdad Railway being a blow at the interests of English
Imperialism, Turkey could only entrust its construction to
the German Company because she knew that Germany's army
and navy stood behind her, which fact makes it appear to
England and Russia inadvisable to exert too sensitive a pressure
upon Turkey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the <i xml:lang="de">Akademische Blätter</i> of June 1, 1911, Professor R.
Mangelsdorf, another recognised authority on German
policy and politics, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The political and military power an organised railway system
will confer upon Turkey is altogether in the interest of Germany,
which can only obtain a share in actual economic developments
if Turkey is independent; and, besides, any attempt to increase
the power and ambition of England, in any case oppressively
great, is thereby effectively thwarted. To some extent, indeed,
Turkey's construction of a railway system is a threat to England,
for it means that an attack on the most vulnerable part
of the body of England's world-empire, namely Egypt, comes
well within the bounds of possibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These declarations and admissions render perfectly clear
the reasons for Germany's professions of friendship for
Turkey and for her desire that that country should become
stronger and more powerful. They also leave no doubt as
to the real purpose the south-western branch of the Baghdad
Railway was designed to effect. The <i>conquest of Egypt</i> by
a combined German and Turkish force was the first object
to be accomplished with the help of the railway extension
to the Egyptian frontier in one direction and to Mecca in
another; but Dr. Rohrbach's suggestion that the loss of
Egypt by England would entail the loss, also, of her possessions
in Central and East Africa has a further bearing
on what has been told in the previous chapter concerning
Germany's designs on Africa as a whole. The strategical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
railways in German South-West Africa; the projected extensions
thereof&mdash;when circumstances permitted; the
German East African lines, <i>and</i> the south-western branch
of the Baghdad Railway in the direction of Egypt were
all to play their part in the eventual creation of a Cape-to-Cairo
German-African Empire.</p>

<p>If we now direct our attention to the south-eastern
branch of the Baghdad Railway, we are met by the repeated
protests made by Germany that in desiring the construction
of a railway to the <i>Persian Gulf</i> she was influenced solely
by commercial considerations. Against these protests,
however, there are to be put various material facts which
leave no room for doubt that Germany's aims in this direction
were otherwise than exclusively economic, while even
the economic purposes which the Baghdad Railway would,
undoubtedly, have served must have eventually led to a
strengthening of Germany's political position, this, in turn,
helping her military and strategical purposes.</p>

<p>As originally planned, the port of Basra (the commercial
centre of trade in Mesopotamia, situate, sixty miles from
the sea, on the Shat-el-Arab&mdash;the great river formed by
the junction of the Tigris and the Euphrates&mdash;and open to
the shipping of the world) was to have been the terminus
of the Baghdad Railway; and if commercial considerations
had, indeed, been exclusively aimed at, this terminus would
have answered all requirements.</p>

<p>No objection was, or could be, raised by the British
Government to the construction of the Baghdad Railway,
on Turkish territory, as far as Basra. In the later developments
of the scheme, however, Germany and her Turkish
partner sought to ensure the continuation of the line from
its natural commercial terminus, at Basra, to a political
and strategical terminus, at Koweit, on the shores of the
Persian Gulf. The <i xml:lang="de">Abendpost</i> (Berlin) voiced the German
view when it spoke of Koweit as "the only possible outlet
to the Baghdad Railway."</p>

<p>But the extension of an avowedly German line of railway
to Koweit would have been a direct challenge to the paramountcy
which Great Britain claimed over the Persian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Gulf. It would have come into collision with British policy,
interests and prestige in the East. It would have given
the German and Turkish allies an excuse for creating at
Koweit a harbour, with wharves, docks, warehouses, etc.,
which might be converted into a naval and military base
capable of serving far different purposes than those of
trade and commerce&mdash;those, namely, of a new line of
advance on <i>India</i>. It would, in combination with the
control already exercised by the Deutsche Bank over the
railways in European Turkey, have assured to Germany
the means of sending her Naval forces or her troops, together
with supplies and ammunition, direct to the Persian Gulf,
either to strengthen her fleet or to carry out any further
designs she might cherish in the domain of <span xml:lang="de">Weltpolitik</span> as
affecting the Far East. It would have meant that, as far
as the head of the Persian Gulf, at least, rail-power would
have rendered her less dependent on the exercise of sea-power,
on her own account, and would have enabled her
to neutralise, also, as far as the said Gulf, the sea-power of
England.</p>

<p>What so fundamental a change in the strategical position
might imply was well expressed by so eminent and impartial
an authority as A. T. Mahan, when he said, in his "Retrospect
and Prospect" (1902):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The control of the Persian Gulf by a foreign State of considerable
naval potentiality, a "fleet in being" there, based
upon a strong military port, would reproduce the relations of
Cadiz, Gibraltar and Malta to the Mediterranean. It would
flank all the routes to the Farther East, to India and to Australia,
the last two actually internal to the Empire, regarded
as a political system; and, although at present Great Britain
unquestionably could check such a fleet, it might well require
a detachment large enough to affect seriously the general strength
of her naval position.... Concession in the Persian Gulf,
whether by positive formal arrangement, or by simple neglect
of the local commercial interests which now underlie political
and military control, will imperil Great Britain's naval situation
in the Farther East, her political position in India, her
commercial interests in both, and the Imperial tie between
herself and Australia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One is thus led to the conclusion that Koweit, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
terminus of the south-eastern branch of the Baghdad Railway,
and within four days of Bombay, would have been as
vital a point for British interests as the terminus of the south-western
branch within about twelve hours of Egypt; while
the possession of this further advantage by Germany would
have been in full accord with the proposition laid down by
Rohrbach and others as to the line of policy Germany should
adopt for "bringing England herself into a dangerous
position."</p>

<p>With a view to safeguarding British interests from any
possible drifting into this position, as regards the Persian
Gulf, the claim was raised, some years ago, that England
should have entire control of the railway from Baghdad to
Koweit. Germany did not see her way to assent to this
proposal; but in 1911 she announced that she would forgo
her right to construct the section from Baghdad to Basra
on the understanding that this final section would be
completed by Turkey. By way of compensation for the
concession thus made by her to British views, she secured
certain financial advantages and the right both to build
the Alexandretta extension and to convert Alexandretta
itself into practically a German port on the shores of the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The precise value of the "concession" thus made by
Germany was, however, open to considerable doubt. If
she could succeed in her long-cherished aim of establishing
a virtual protectorate over Turkey, then the fact that the
final section of the Baghdad Railway had been built by
Turkey, and not by Germany, would have become a matter
of detail not likely to affect the reality of Germany's control.
The line to Basra might have been nominally Turkish but
the directing policy would have been German; and like
conditions would have arisen had Great Britain agreed to
allow Turkey&mdash;though not Germany&mdash;to continue the railway
from Basra to Koweit.</p>

<p>In the wide scope of their aggressive purpose, the Baghdad
Railway and its associated lines can best be compared
with those roads which the Romans, in the days of their
pride&mdash;the pride that came before their fall&mdash;built for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
better achievement of their own aims as world-conquerors.
Apart from the fact that the roads now in question are iron
roads, and that the locomotive has superseded the chariot,
the main difference between Roman and German is to be
found in the fact that the world which the former sought to
conquer was far smaller than the one coveted by the latter.</p>

<p>The programme of <span xml:lang="de">Weltpolitik</span> comprised in the German
schemes embraced not only countries but continents. In
addition to the aspirations cherished as regards Europe,
that programme aimed at the eventual annexation to the
German Empire of three other Empires&mdash;the Turkish, the
Indian, and a new one to be known as the German-African.
It was further to secure the means of sending troops direct
from Germany via Constantinople and the Baghdad Railway
to the frontiers of Persia for possible operations against that
country in combination with the Turkish military forces,
these having first been brought under German control.
The Baghdad Railway itself was, in the same way, and with
like support, to afford to Germany the means of threatening
Russian interests both in Persia and in Trans-Caucasia.
It was to nullify England's sea power in the Mediterranean,
if not, to a certain extent&mdash;through the establishment of
a new Power at the gate of India&mdash;in the Far East, as well.
It would, as Mahan showed, have flanked our communications
with Australia, giving Germany an advantage in this
direction, also, had Asia and Africa failed to satisfy her
aspirations.</p>

<p>Regarded from the point of view of its designed effect
on the destinies of nations, on the balance of political power,
and on the reconstruction of the world's forces&mdash;all for the
aggrandisement of a single people&mdash;the full programme
must be looked upon as the most ambitious and the most
unscrupulous project of world-conquest that has yet been
placed on record in the history of mankind.</p>

<p>For its attainment, however, it clearly depended no less
upon rail-transport than upon force of arms; and in this
respect it represented Germany's greatest attempt to apply,
in practice, that principle of rail-power to which she had
devoted eight decades of inquiry, trial and organisation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="smcap">Summary and Conclusions</span></h2>


<p>As will have been gathered from the preceding chapters, a
prolonged period of consideration, preparation and application
in many different countries throughout the world,
prior to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, had established
certain definite facts and fundamental principles in
regard to the relations of railways to warfare in general.
These may now be brought together and summarised in
four groups or divisions, namely, (A) Advantages; (B)
Conditions Essential to Efficiency; (C) Limitations in
Usefulness; and (D) Drawbacks and Disadvantages.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A.&mdash;Advantages</span></h3>

<p>Assuming (1) the provision, in advance, of a system or systems
of railways capable of meeting all the requirements
of the military situation on the outbreak of war, or (2)
the possibility of constructing military railways during the
progress of hostilities, such railways should permit of&mdash;</p>

<p>A mobilisation of troops and their concentration at the
frontier, or at the seat of war, with a speed that was
impossible under earlier conditions.</p>

<p>Simultaneous use of different routes across the national
territory for concentration either on the frontier or at a
point some distance therefrom where the concentration
can be completed without fear of interruption by the enemy.</p>

<p>Sudden invasion of neighbouring territory by troops
sent in a succession of rapidly-following trains direct from
various points in the interior of the country where they
might have been concentrated without the knowledge of
the enemy, this procedure being adopted in preference to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
collecting at the frontier in advance a force on such a scale
as would disclose prematurely the intentions entertained.</p>

<p>The possibility of using promptly, for these purposes,
the full strength of the country's available resources&mdash;the
railway lines in the interior having already been adapted
thereto, as well as those on or directly connecting with the
frontier&mdash;with a proportionate increase of the offensive
and defensive power of the State.</p>

<p>The supplementing of increased mobility and celerity by
decreased strain on the physical powers of the troops and
the avoidance of such inevitable reduction in their numbers
as would result from the trials and fatigues of prolonged
marches by road (in combination with the carrying of kits,
etc.), should railway lines not be available.</p>

<p>A further consequent increase in the fighting strength of
the army.</p>

<p>The possible attainment of the power of initiative through
an early concentration of large forces at points of strategic
importance either on national or on enemy's territory.<a id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The carrying out of strategical combinations on a scale
or of a character which would formerly have been impracticable.</p>

<p>Employment of railways for tactical purposes during the
progress of a war, including therein (<i>a</i>) movement of troops
from one part of the theatre of war to another, whether with
a view to effecting big changes of front or otherwise; (<i>b</i>)
employment of the same Army Corps on different fronts in
succession, their transfer being effected in the briefest possible
interval of time; (<i>c</i>) the rapid bringing up of reinforcements
at a critical moment to some position exposed to
overpowering attack which might otherwise be lost; (<i>d</i>)
surprise attacks on the enemy; (<i>e</i>) the throwing of great
masses of troops on distant points; (<i>f</i>) strengthening weak
places in the fighting line; (<i>g</i>) strengthening threatened
forts by means of troops, guns, munitions or supplies; (<i>h</i>)
relief of invested fortresses, and (<i>i</i>) retirement by rail&mdash;when
circumstances permit&mdash;of troops after defeat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>Control of a line of rail communication between the base
and the strategic centre of operations, facilitating the
enormous amount of transport in both directions which
must be kept up in the rear of the army, and for which the
elements of speed, safety and regularity may be of vital
importance.</p>

<p>The possibility, thanks to railways, of regarding the whole
interior of the national territory as a base for the supply of
requirements at the front, dependence having no longer to
be placed on a base established in one particular district
with its restricted range of possible supplies and its collection
of magazines, stores, workshops, transport parks, etc.,
protected by fortresses, entrenched camps, or other means
of defence.</p>

<p>The establishment of supplementary, sectional or advanced
bases along the line of communication, with railway
services so arranged that supplies can be dispatched daily
in such regulated quantities, and to such points, as will serve
the immediate needs of the army in the field, without risk
either of shortage or of excess.</p>

<p>Avoidance, under these conditions, of congestion of the
railway lines in the immediate rear of the army by trains or
loaded wagons containing a redundancy of supplies which
(<i>a</i>) cannot be unloaded, (<i>b</i>) restrict the use of the lines for
other purposes, and (<i>c</i>) might have to be abandoned to the
enemy in the event of a sudden retreat.</p>

<p>Material benefits from the substitution of rail for road
transport of food, etc., by reason of (<i>a</i>) greater speed and
regularity; (<i>b</i>) less risk of deterioration from exposure to
weather, and other causes; (<i>c</i>) decreased cost of transport
as compared with earlier conditions involving the employment
of a greater number of drivers, escort, guards, horses
and road vehicles; and (<i>d</i>) the arrival at destination of the
full quantities dispatched, the need for the consumption<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
of an appreciable proportion <i>en route</i> by men and animals
in a convoying wagon train, carrying supplies for long
distances by road, being non-existent.</p>

<p>Reduction in the need for field ovens and other paraphernalia
of the army cook, since much of the food required&mdash;bread,
for example&mdash;can be prepared in cities or elsewhere
at a distant base and forwarded regularly by rail.</p>

<p>Freedom, more or less complete, from the once prevalent
obligation on the part of an advancing army that it should
"live upon the country"&mdash;a condition which the enormous
increase in the size of armies to-day would render impossible
of fulfilment, even assuming that the people of the country
invaded had not withdrawn live stock, vehicles and food
supplies on their retirement before the invader.</p>

<p>In addition to this provision for the wants of an army in
its advance into hostile country, the safeguarding of the
troops against the risk of their becoming a band of demoralized
marauders, wandering over a wide area to seek and
appropriate food whenever they can find it&mdash;as was the
case, for instance, in the Napoleonic wars&mdash;the maintenance
of discipline and the continued usefulness of the troops as a
concentrated body for the military purposes in view being
further assured when both men and leaders are relieved
of anxiety as to the continuance of their supplies.</p>

<p>The conduct of war at a great distance from the base by
reason of the facilities offered for the forwarding alike of
troops, reinforcements, supplies and military materials,
the value of even a single line of railway in the achievement
of this purpose having been incontestably established.</p>

<p>Defence of frontiers by strategical railways which may,
also, become available for general use.</p>

<p>Investment of cities or fortresses in occupied territory
when, owing to the lack or the deficiency of food supplies
in the surrounding country, the troops engaged are mainly
if not entirely dependent on those brought to them by rail
from their own base.<a id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>
<p>Victualling of cities before, and their revictualling after,
investment.<a id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Extension of lines of communication by means of quickly-constructed
narrow-gauge siege railways to be operated
by motor traction, animal power, or otherwise, including
therein trench tramways for (<i>a</i>) removal of wounded men
from the trenches; (<i>b</i>) transport of siege guns to trenches;
and (<i>c</i>) supplying ammunition to battery.</p>

<p>Transport of heavy siege guns, mortars, ammunition and
other materials of a size or weight that would render impracticable
their conveyance, whether singly or in the
aggregate, along ordinary roads, the railway offering, in this
respect, facilities for ponderous transport comparable to
those of the steamship, with the further advantage of being
able, in most instances, to take the guns, etc., to the spot
or to the locality where they are wanted.</p>

<p>Material aid given to expeditions to countries otherwise
devoid of means of communication, by the construction of
military railways.</p>

<p>Employment of armoured trains which, apart from their
usefulness in defending railways against attack, may, as
movable fortresses, render important service in the operations
against the enemy.</p>

<p>Removal of sick and wounded from the theatre of war,
and the ensuring of their distribution among hospitals in
the rear or throughout the interior, thus (<i>a</i>) avoiding alike
the embarrassment to the army and the many dangers and
evils that would result from their remaining in overcrowded
hospitals on or near the battle-field; (<i>b</i>) giving the men a
better chance of effecting a speedy recovery and returning
soon to the ranks; and (<i>c</i>) adding to the fighting strength
of the army by the combination of these two advantages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>
<p>Facilities for giving a short leave to officers and men who,
though neither sick nor wounded, have been so far affected
by their strenuous exertions that they stand in need of
a rest, or change, for which they will fight all the better
subsequently.</p>

<p>Dispatch of prisoners of war into the interior by trains
which have brought reinforcements or supplies, the army
thus being speedily relieved of what might otherwise be a
hindrance to its operations.</p>

<p>Return of material no longer wanted at the front and
constituting impedimenta of which it is desirable to get
rid as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Conveyance into the interior of "trophies of war"&mdash;including
plunder&mdash;taken from captured towns or cities.</p>

<p>Retirement of troops from occupied territory on the
declaration of peace.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">B.&mdash;Conditions Essential to Efficiency</span></h3>

<p>In the matter of railway construction there should be&mdash;</p>

<p>i. Uniformity of gauge, together with physical connections
between the different systems or sections, in order
(<i>a</i>) that the locomotives and rolling stock on any one
line can be used for military transport on any other; (<i>b</i>)
that mobilisation, concentration and the forwarding of supplies
and military material can be facilitated by the running
of through trains from any probable or possible point
of dispatch; and (<i>c</i>) that troops can readily be transferred
from one front, or from one part of the coast, to another
for the purpose either of attack or of defence.</p>

<p>ii. Lines linking up the interior of the country with the
frontier, with the coast, or with principal ports by different
routes, transverse lines connecting them, in turn, one with
another.</p>

<p>iii. Double track for all lines leading direct to the frontier.</p>

<p>iv. In the case of single-track lines crossing continents or
otherwise, a liberal provision of passing places each capable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
of accommodating the longest troop train likely to be run.</p>

<p>v. On all lines, and at all important stations, a sufficiency
of sidings, with provision of, or the possibility of providing
speedily, all such facilities as may be needed for the prompt
and efficient handling of military transports whenever the
occasion should arise.</p>

<p>Preparations in advance should include&mdash;</p>

<p>i. The carrying out of a scheme of organisation based
on recognition of the following principles:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) That, while
the railway is an instrument capable of rendering great and
even incalculable services in the conduct of war, the working
of it is a highly-skilled business only to be entrusted to those
possessed of the necessary experience; (<i>b</i>) that interference
with such working on the part of military officers not possessing
the requisite technical knowledge of the details and
limitations of railway operation may result in chaos and
disaster; (<i>c</i>) that railwaymen, in turn, are not likely to
be fully acquainted with the technicalities of military conditions
and requirements, and should not, in any case, be
left with the responsibility of having to decide between the
possibly conflicting demands of various military authorities;
(<i>d</i>) that, for these reasons, there should be co-ordination
of the military and the technical railway elements, operating
throughout the whole scheme of organisation in its manifold
details, avoiding conflict of authority, ensuring harmony
of working, and offering the fullest guarantee that all
military requirements will be met so far as the capacity of
the railway, together with a due regard for safe and efficient
operation, will allow; and (<i>e</i>) that effect can best be given
to these various conditions by the appointment of intermediary
bodies which, representing the dual elements, shall
alone have power to give directions, or to make demands,
in respect to military rail-transport during the continuance
of war.</p>

<p>ii. Collection of data concerning the physical character,
resources and transport capabilities of the railways both in
the national territory and in any other country to which the
war operations may extend.</p>

<p>iii. Study of all movements of troops, etc., likely to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
necessary on the outbreak of war; the preparation of special
time-tables for the running of troop trains, etc., and the
working out of all essential details respecting military
transport in general.</p>

<p>iv. Creation and training of bodies of Railway Troops
qualified to undertake the construction, destruction, repair
and operation of railways in time of war.</p>


<h3>C.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Limitations in Usefulness</span></h3>

<p>The usefulness of railways in war is limited by the following
considerations, among others:&mdash;</p>

<p>Railways are "inferior to ships in power of simultaneously
transporting heavy loads" (Von der Goltz). For
this reason an overland route to India could never compete,
in respect to military transport, with the sea route via the
Suez Canal. Such overland route, also, passing through
foreign countries, would be especially liable to attack and
interruption. Where, however, the overland route goes
entirely through national territory (as in the case of the
Trans-Siberian Railway), and when the questions of time
and safety, in regard to an alternative sea route, suggest
possible disadvantages, railways will be preferred to ships
in spite of the said inferiority.</p>

<p>Railways are inferior to roads in so far as, like rivers and
canals, they are on fixed spots. Troops depending on them
are thus able to move only in the direction in which lines
have been or can quickly be laid, whereas if they went by
road they might have a greater choice of alternative routes.</p>

<p>For these reasons the choice of the zone of concentration
or of the "decisive points" may depend less to-day on
political, military or geographical reasons (as in the Napoleonic
wars) than on the direction, extent and capacity of
the available railways.</p>

<p>Great masses of troops can be entrained only at stations
where facilities for their so doing have been prepared in
advance. The provision of these facilities is even more
necessary in the case of Cavalry or Artillery than in that of
Infantry. Hence the movement of considerable bodies of
troops may be restricted to certain lines, and their entrainment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
or detrainment even to certain large stations. In
the case of road marching these restrictions would not apply.</p>

<p>Vehicles specially constructed for the purpose can alone
be used on railways. Any deficiency in their supply must
needs cause delay.</p>

<p>During the time the troops are travelling by railway their
power of resisting attack is much more restricted than it
would be if they were marching by road, they can do little
or nothing to protect the railway lines, while if the enemy
can only get to the railway he may be in a position to prevent
the train from continuing its journey, and take the
troops in it at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>For these reasons, among others, troop movements by
rail at the theatre of war, and especially in the enemy's
country, are attended by a degree of risk which may render
it desirable to abandon the use of the railway for the time
being.</p>

<p>Railways are especially liable to destruction by the enemy,
and, although the arrangements made in advance may
permit of speedy repairs or reconstruction, the interruption
of traffic for even a day or half a day may be a matter of
grave importance during the concentration of the army or
at some critical moment.</p>

<p>Destructions of line carried out by a retreating force, in
order to delay pursuit by the enemy, will be to the disadvantage
of that force when, after having driven back the
enemy, it would itself make use of the line it had rendered
unserviceable.</p>

<p>Dependence on the railway for the transport of considerable
bodies of troops on short journeys&mdash;say for twenty,
twenty-five or thirty miles&mdash;is rendered inexpedient by the
fact that, when allowance is made for the time likely to be
taken, not only on the journey, but in the assembling at the
station, in the entraining and detraining (perhaps at some
place devoid of adequate platform or siding accommodation),
and in the march from the arrival station to destination, it
may well be found that the troops could cover the distance
in less time by road, apart from the consideration, suggested
above, as to their being in a better position, when marching,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
to resist attack. Experts in all countries have studied this
question with a view to deciding, on the basis of their
national conditions, within what limit it would be better
for troops to march by road in preference to going by rail.</p>

<p>For reasons akin to those here stated, supplemented by
the recent great expansion of motor transport, less has been
heard of late concerning the proposed construction in this
country of strategical railways along a coast-line remarkable
for its sinuosities, and presenting, therefore, an exceptional
position from the point of view of coast railways for purely
defensive purposes.</p>

<p>As regards long-distance journeys, whilst armies marching
by road have often been materially reduced in proportions
by the number of men falling out owing to lameness,
exhaustion, or other causes, those who reached the theatre of
war, representing "the survival of the fittest," were better
able to endure the trials and fatigues of the subsequent
campaign than if they could have made the journey by rail
under conditions involving no strain, but affording them
no such exercise and strengthening of their physical powers.<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>
<p>Experience has further shown that exceptionally long
railway journeys may have a prejudicial effect upon troops
from the point of view, also, of maintenance of discipline.<a id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The services rendered by railways in war relate much
more to strategy than to tactics. Great masses of troops
and munitions, brought from all parts of the interior, may
be conveyed readily and safely by rail to particular points
in the theatre of war; but the possibility of effecting their
transport by rail from one point to another on the battle-field
when the opposing forces are in actual contact is subject
to many restrictions and constitutes a much more difficult
undertaking.</p>

<p>The imperative need for guarding a long line of railway
communications, more especially in occupied territory,
may lead to the withdrawal of a considerable number of
men from the main army, weakening the strength of the
available fighting force proportionately.</p>


<h3>D.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Drawbacks and Disadvantages</span></h3>

<p>While, notwithstanding the conditions to be observed
and the limitations to be experienced, the balance of advantage
conferred by railways on the conduct of war may
appear so pronounced, from a military and a political point
of view, there is a darker side to the story, as regards the
world at large, which must also be taken into account.</p>

<p>If railways have increased the power of defending a
country against invasion they have, also, increased enormously
the power of aggression at the command of an invader.</p>

<p>They offer vastly greater facilities to military Powers for
the making of sudden attacks on neighbouring countries&mdash;themselves,
it may be, in a state of more or less unpreparedness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>
<p>They afford the opportunity for overwhelming weaker
Powers by means of armies mobilised and concentrated in
the interior and poured on to or across the frontier in an
endless succession of trains following one another with such
rapidity that the initial movement may, in some instances,
be carried out within the short space of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>They permit of the prosecution of war at distances which,
but for the means offered for military transport by rail,
would render war impracticable.</p>

<p>They allow of war being carried on between a number of
nations at one and the same time, thus spreading the area
over which the conflicts of to-day may extend.</p>

<p>They encourage the cherishing of designs of world-power
and dreams of universal conquest.</p>

<p>They have added to the horrors of war by facilitating the
transport and the employment of the most terrible engines
of war.</p>

<p>They have rendered possible the carrying off of plunder
from an occupied territory to an extent which would be
impossible if the invaders had to depend on ordinary road
vehicles for their means of transport.</p>

<p>They have brought fresh risks and dangers upon civil
populations, the maintenance of lines of rail communication
being a matter of such paramount importance to an invader
that the severest measures may be adopted by him towards
the community in general as a means of terrorising them
and ensuring the security of the railway lines.</p>

<p>What, in effect, count as "advantages" in one direction
may be the gravest of disadvantages in another.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such, for attack or for defence, for good or for evil, is the
nature, and such are the possibilities, of that rail-power in
warfare which, after eighty years of continuous evolution,
was, in the War of the Nations imposed on mankind in
1914, to undergo a development and an application on a
wider, more impressive, and more terrible scale than the
world had ever seen before.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> Von Moltke is reported to have said on one occasion in the
Reichstag: "Our Great General Staff is so much persuaded of
the advantages to be derived from obtaining the initiative at the
outset of a war that it prefers to construct railways rather than
forts. An additional railway, crossing the whole country, makes
a difference of two days in the assembling of the army, and advances
the operations proportionately." "In the concentration of armies,"

brought into the city, in the course of twenty days, 155,955 tons
of provisions and 42,580 head of cattle.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_81_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> "The railways spare the troops fatigue," remarks Lieut.-Col.
Tovey, R.E., in "The Elements of Strategy"; "but it may be that
when they have to use their legs afterwards there will be more
falling out and lagging behind, in consequence." Balck, in his
"<span xml:lang="de">Taktik</span>," says: "It is only in respect to the important consideration
as to speed that the rail-transport of troops is to be preferred
to road-marching. The real advantages of marching on foot&mdash;which
was formerly the rule, and had the effect of 'separating the
chaff from the wheat' and of preparing the men for the toils of
fighting&mdash;are not counterbalanced by the fact that the troops
arrive at the theatre of war in their full numbers. When time
permits, marching on foot is preferable because it accustoms the
men both to their new equipment and to marching in large bodies.
After a long railway journey&mdash;on which the feet will have swollen
and the new boots will have been especially troublesome&mdash;marching
becomes particularly irksome, and the falling out of footsore men
is very considerable. It is, nevertheless, the almost invariable
rule that the troops shall begin their marching immediately they get
to the end of the rail journey, since it may be a matter of great
importance that the station at which they detrain should be cleared
again as soon as possible."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_82_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> In alluding to the conditions under which Russian reinforcements
were sent to Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese War,
General Kuropatkin writes ("The Russian Army and the Japanese
War"): "In former days troops had to make long marches in
full service order before they reached the battle-field. If properly
conducted these marches hardened the men, and enabled units
to settle down; all superfluous luggage was discarded; the weaker
men were left behind; the officers and men got to know one another.
But, nowadays, with railway transport, the results are very different.
Going to the Far East, our men were crowded in railway carriages
for as long as forty days at a time, out of the control of their officers,
who were in different compartments. In the old and well-disciplined
units in particular no harm was done; but in the case of newly-formed
units ... it was most harmful."</p></div></div>

<h2>Appendix</h2>


<h3>INDIAN FRONTIER RAILWAYS</h3>

<p>On the north-west frontier of India the plains of the Punjab
are separated from the great central valley of Afghanistan,
from the deserts of Baluchistan, and from the Russian Empire
on the north thereof, by ranges of mountains, otherwise "a
gridiron of stupendous ridges and furrows," intersected by
passes which have always been regarded as the most vulnerable
points of the Indian Empire. Through these passes from the
earliest days of recorded history there has come a long succession
of invasions instigated by that incalculable wealth of India
which may well have inspired the envy of dwellers in less favoured
lands.<a id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>These considerations would alone suffice to establish the
need for an effective control of the more important of the said
passes by the Power which exercises supremacy in India; but
the obligation thus devolving upon the British people as the
present holders of that supremacy has been increased in recent
times by two further factors&mdash;(1) troubles with frontier tribes;
and (2) the development of that Central Asian Question which,
though now no longer acute, was, not so many years ago, a
source of great anxiety in England and India. Frontier troubles
gave rise to a number of expeditions to Afghanistan from time
to time, while the gravity of the general situation was increased
by the once steady advance of Russia towards India&mdash;whether
for the purposes of actual conquest thereof or, alternatively, for
the attainment of the aim cherished by Russia during three
centuries for an outlet to a southern sea, such outlet being
sought via the Persian Gulf on her disappointment in regard to
the Dardanelles; though British interests were concerned in
either case.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>
<p>This combination of circumstances, with the possibility, at
one time, that Afghanistan might become the theatre of war
in a conflict between two great European Powers, invested with
special interest and importance the provision on the north-west
frontier of India of railway lines which, whether constructed
to the more important passes or going actually through them,
would form a ready means of concentrating Anglo-Indian troops
at such places on the frontier, or beyond, as occasion might
require.</p>

<p>From this point of view the Bolan and Khyber passes&mdash;the
former leading to Quetta and Kandahar and the latter to Kabul&mdash;have
more especially had importance attached to them as "the
two gates of India."</p>

<p>Proposals for constructing railways through them were advanced
as early as 1857, when Mr. (afterwards Sir) W. P. Andrew,
chairman of the Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway, acted as
spokesman of a deputation which waited on Lord Palmerston
in order to urge the construction of (1) a railway down the valley
of the Euphrates, improving our communications with India by
connecting the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf; and (2)
railways through the Bolan and Khyber passes, not only, as he
urged, facilitating the movement of troops to the frontier, but
offering alternative routes by means of which the flank or the
rear of an enemy operating beyond or between the limits of the
two lines might be threatened. Mr. Andrew followed up with
great earnestness and perseverance for many years his advocacy
of these views, publishing a succession of books and pamphlets,
and writing many letters to the Press on the subject.</p>

<p>Such advocacy had, however, no practical issue, and, though
the arguments originally advanced in favour of the Euphrates
railway lost most of their force on the opening of the Suez Canal,
the consequences of the neglect to provide better means of
communication with the north-west frontier were well manifested
in the troubles of 1878-79-80.</p>

<p>The refusal of the Ameer of Afghanistan&mdash;who had already
accorded an ostentatious welcome to a Russian Embassy at
Kabul&mdash;to receive a British mission led, in 1878, to an order
being given for the advance of three columns of British forces
upon Afghan territory, the routes selected for this purpose being
(1) the Khyber Pass, (2) the Kuram Pass, and (3) the Bolan Pass.
At this time, however, the system of frontier railways which had
been advocated so long scarcely existed except on paper. The
nearest point of railway communication with Afghanistan was
then at Sukkur, on the Indus. An extension across the Sind
desert to the entrance to the Bolan Pass had been surveyed, and
a very short section had been laid; but in their advance on
Kandahar Sir Donald Stewart and his force had to march all the
way from the Indus, experiencing great trials in crossing the
intervening desert, where many of the men lost their lives. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
work of constructing this desert railway&mdash;which presented no
engineering difficulty&mdash;was now taken actively in hand, and the
line was available for the troops on their return.</p>

<p>Success attended the expedition of 1878 so far as it led to the
flight of Shere Ali, the occupation of Kandahar by Sir Donald
Stewart, the control by the British of the three main highways
between India and Afghanistan, and the signing of the treaty
of Gandamak; but the murder of Sir Louis Cavagnari and his
staff at Kabul, in September, 1879, rendered necessary the sending
of a further expedition, General Sir Frederick (afterwards
Lord) Roberts being directed to proceed with a British force by
the Kuram route to Kabul.</p>

<p>Thereupon the whole question of transport facilities was revived
afresh, and, although the expedition itself was a conspicuous
success, delays and commissariat difficulties arose which
might have been avoided had better railway facilities been available.<a id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
The terminus, at that time, of the Punjab State Railway
was at Jhelum, seventy miles from Rawal Pindi, 180 from
Peshawar, and 260 from Thal, the frontier post of the Kuram
pass; and in spite of the vigorous efforts made, between 1878
and 1880, to extend the line, Jhelum remained the actual railway
base throughout, no material assistance being gained from the
twenty miles of extension which, owing to the great engineering
difficulties presented by innumerable ravines, could alone be
carried out during that period. Commenting on the "painfully
slow" progress being made by the Khyber column, <i>The Times</i> of
October 13, 1879, remarked:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is now upwards of a quarter of a century since the chairman
of the Sind railway commenced to broach the idea of connecting
the Khyber and Bolan passes with the railway system of India.
For more than a quarter of a century he has unsparingly advocated
these views.... Had the views so persistently advocated by Mr.
Andrew, and so repeatedly brought forward by us, been adopted
at the commencement of the struggle last October, as we then
ventured to insist upon, vast sums would have been spared in the
hire of transport, and we should have been spared the ignominy of
feeling that a British army, nominally on active service, has occupied
five weeks in covering less than seventy miles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>
<p>Rawal Pindi&mdash;one of the most important strategical points
in India&mdash;was not reached by the railway until October, 1880,
by which time the Afghan War of 1878-80 had been brought to
a close; and the further extension of the Indian railway system
to Peshawar,&mdash;another position of the utmost strategic importance,
situate ten miles from the entrance to the Khyber Pass,
and 190 from Kabul&mdash;was effected by May, 1883.</p>

<p>From a military point of view, however, still greater importance
was attached, at that time, to the securing of rail communication
through the Bolan Pass to Quetta and Pishin in the direction
of Kandahar, this being the route by which, it was thought,
the Russians would be certain to attempt their invasion of India,&mdash;if
they should undertake one at all.</p>

<p>Surveys for an extension of the Sukkur-Sibi desert line to
Pishin were made whilst that line was under construction, and
early in 1880 the Government gave directions that the extension
was to be proceeded with; though they decided that the route
to be taken from Sibi should be through the Hurnai Pass in
preference to the Bolan route, the former being regarded as
preferable for the broad-gauge line (5 ft. 6 in.) with which the
"Kandahar State Railway," as it was to be called, would be
provided.</p>

<p>Arrangements were at once made for collecting the necessary
materials and for carrying through the work with the least possible
delay; but further progress was checked, in July, 1880, by
the disaster at Maiwand. In the following October the Gladstone
Government, who had succeeded the Beaconsfield Administration
and had, apparently, resolved upon a complete reversal
of the Indian policy of their predecessors, followed up an earlier
announcement of their intention to withdraw from Kandahar by
giving orders for the cessation of the work on the Sind-Pishin
railway. Maiwand having been avenged, and some refractory
tribes subdued, Afghanistan was completely evacuated by the
British at the end of April, 1881, and the construction of frontier
railways in India was dropped, for the time being.</p>

<p>In the middle of 1883 came a reconsideration of the position.
Russia was then showing increased activity in the direction of
Merv, and the British Government concluded, apparently, that
they had been too hasty in ordering the abandonment of the
Kandahar State Railway scheme nearly three years before. So
they gave orders that the work should be resumed; though, in
order to render this <i xml:lang="fr">volte face</i> on their part less conspicuous,
they directed that the undertaking should now be known only
as the "Hurnai Road Improvement Scheme"; that it should
be proceeded with quietly, in order that it might not attract too
much attention, and that the suggestion of a "road improvement
scheme," instead of a railway, should be kept up by the
engineers not being allowed to have even a temporary line of
rails for conveying stores, materials for bridges, etc., from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
base to the passes. This last-mentioned stipulation meant that
the stores and materials had to be either transported on the
backs of camels or dragged on wheels up stream; and it was
estimated that, in addition to the great loss of time, a sum of not
less than £1,000,000 was wasted in this way before the order
prohibiting the use of temporary rails was rescinded.</p>

<p>A start was made with the work in October, 1883, and the
fact that the Russians were then actually approaching Merv,
and that a sudden advance by them in force was regarded as
probable, led to the laying of great emphasis on the need for
construction being pushed on with the utmost vigour. When,
in February, 1884, the Russians did occupy Merv, the pressure
brought to bear on the Engineer-in-chief became still more acute.
Then, in May, the British Government formally announced that,
owing to the encroachments of Russia, the line <i>would</i> be built.
The fiction of a "Hurnai Road Improvement Scheme" was now
abandoned. Henceforth the line under construction was to be
known as "The Sind-Pishin State Railway."</p>

<p>From the very outset, however, the difficulties which crowded
upon Colonel (afterwards Sir James) Browne, R.E., an officer
well experienced in railway and engineering work who was
entrusted with the carrying out of the scheme, were unfavourable
to the prospects of speed in construction. The surveys which
had already been made were found not only worthless but misleading.
The first members of his staff were unacquainted with
railway work and had to be succeeded by men brought from
England. The plant and materials previously collected, but
disposed of at scrap-iron prices when the line was abandoned in
1880, had now to be replaced at an almost fabulous cost, owing
to the urgency of the need for them.</p>

<p>All these were, nevertheless, minor troubles as compared with
the physical conditions to be overcome.</p>

<p>Starting from an elevation, at Sibi, of 300 ft., the line was to
rise 6,200 ft. in the 120 miles between Sibi and the summit level
at Kach.</p>

<p>Then, for the greater part of the 224 miles to which the line
was to extend, the country was a wilderness of rocks and stones&mdash;a
land of barrenness and desolation, where there was no
timber, no fuel, scarcely a blade of grass, and, in places, for
stretches of several miles, no water. It was a land, too, almost
devoid of inhabitants, while those who did dwell there were
described as "a savage and blood-thirsty race of robbers,"
continually engaged in plunder and inter-tribal warfare, and not
growing sufficient food even for their own consumption. Almost
everything that was wanted&mdash;including supplies for from 15,000
to 30,000 workers and materials for the line&mdash;had to be imported
from a distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>Still less inviting was this inhospitable region by reason of
its range of climatic conditions. The lowlands have the reputation
of being one of the hottest corners of the earth's surface.
A temperature of 124 deg. Fahr. has been registered in the Nari
valley. The highlands, in turn, offer the alternative of Arctic
cold, the temperature there falling in winter to 18 deg. below
zero. Between the lowlands and the highlands there is a temperate
zone; but here the constant pestilence was dreaded no
less than the extremes of heat and cold elsewhere.</p>

<p>As the result of these conditions, the work of construction
could be carried on in certain districts for part of the year only,
and the workers had to be transferred from one section of the
line to another according to the season. Such a movement of
front involved the transport of everything,&mdash;stores, tools, offices
and some thousands of men. "The management of this vast
exodus," says Captain Scott-Moncrieff, R.E., in his paper on
"The Frontier Railways of India,"<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> "was a work of considerable
anxiety and difficulty. A sudden influx of people, such as this,
into a desolate and barren land naturally caused a famine.
Everything was eaten up, and for some days the question of
supplies was the burning question of the hour.... Nine
hundred camel loads of food were consumed daily on the works."
The customary load for a camel was 400 lbs., but some of the
camels carried loads of 800 lbs. up the pass.</p>

<p>The engineering difficulties fell into four principal groups,&mdash;(1)
the Nari Gorge; (2) the Gundakin Defile; (3) the Chuppur
Rift, and (4) the Mud Gorge.<a id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The Nari Gorge, about fourteen miles in length, beginning
just beyond Sibi, has been described as "one of the most weird
tracks through which a railway has ever been carried. The hills,
absolutely bare, rise above the valley for many thousands of
feet in fantastic pinnacles and cliffs. It is a scene of the wildest
desolation." The Nari river, running through the gorge, is
formed by a combination of three streams having but little water
on ordinary occasions, but becoming, in time of flood, a raging
torrent which fills up the whole gorge for miles, attains a depth
of ten feet, and has a velocity of five feet per second. Over this
river the railway had to be carried in five different places. Not
alone bridges, but heavy embankments, cuttings and tunnels
were needed. At one point there was an especially dangerous
tunnel in which so many accidents occurred, owing to roof or
sides falling in, that at last no workmen would enter it except at
a wage five-fold that of the high rate already being paid. The
whole work was liable to be stopped for months together, owing
to the washing away of half-completed embankments or bridges;
though until this portion of the line had been completed no
materials could be sent to the sections beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Gundakin Defile, eight miles long, two tunnels had to
be made through some most treacherous material, and four
bridges had to be provided.</p>

<p>The Chuppur Rift is a chasm three miles long in the spurs of
a rocky mountain forming an apparently insuperable barrier.
In time of floods the river attains a height of from 30 to 40 ft.
The running of the railway on a ledge along the side of the
mountain being impracticable, owing to the nature of the rock,
the engineers cut a line of continuous tunnels partly on one side
of the rift and partly on the other, connecting the two series by
an iron girder bridge; but, instead of constructing the tunnels
in the usual way, from each end&mdash;a procedure which would have
taken much time&mdash;they adopted the expedient of driving openings
(adits) into the side of the cliff at various points, and then
cutting the tunnel right and left of each of these openings until
the various sections met. The only way in which the openings
could be made was by lowering men down by ropes several
hundred feet from the top of the cliff until they reached the
point where the work for an opening was to be started. They
then drove crowbars into the perpendicular sides of the cliff in
order to gain the necessary support for a platform from which
the blasting operations could be carried on. Six of these openings
were made on one side of the cliff and six on the other. As a
separate gang of men could operate at each it was possible to complete
the whole work in the course of a few months. Altogether
there is a collective length of 6,400 ft. of tunnels in the rift, in
addition to a viaduct 75 ft. high, with seven spans of 40 ft. each,
and a bridge having an elevation over the river of 250 ft., and
consisting of a central span of 150 ft. and eight spans of 40 ft.</p>

<p>On the summit level, twenty-five miles in length, came the
five-mile long Mud Gorge,&mdash;a narrow valley, between precipitous
mountains, filled with a soil little better than dried mud, and of
such a character that several bad slips of road-bed, carrying
away the whole of the line, occurred.</p>

<p>One would think that with all these difficulties&mdash;physical,
climatic and engineering&mdash;to face, the constructors of the railway
might have been excused any more; but there were others
besides.</p>

<p>In August and September, 1884, the troops and native labourers
employed on the work on the lower part of the line were visited
by an outbreak of fever and scurvy of a virulence almost unprecedented
in Indian experience. Large numbers of the men died.
In one gang of 200 the average number of deaths was ten a day.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Of those who survived the majority were so prostrated as to be
scarcely capable of doing anything. Sixty per cent. of the Sappers
were in hospital.</p>

<p>Fresh troops, to the extent of three Battalions of Pioneers,
were brought on to the work; but they had scarcely arrived
before&mdash;in November&mdash;there was a severe outbreak of cholera.
The Afghans thereupon "bolted to a man"; and they were
followed by many skilled artisans who had been collected from
various parts of India. Additional labour had to be obtained
from the Eastern Punjab, but much time was lost.</p>

<p>Whilst the engineers were struggling to overcome these manifold
difficulties, the political situation was steadily becoming
still more acute. The climax seemed to be reached by the
Penj-deh incident of March 30, 1885, when a Russian force under
General Komaroff seized this important strategical position,
situate near the junction of the Khushk and Murghab rivers.
On April 27, 1885, Mr. Gladstone proposed in the House of
Commons a vote of £11,000,000 for the purposes of what then
seemed to be an inevitable war with Russia. The money was
voted the same night.</p>

<p>So the urgency for completing the line which would now,
probably, have been available for use had it not been stopped
in 1880, was greater than ever. Orders were sent to India that
the work must be continued along all parts of the line regardless
of seasons. Within a week or two, however, of the war vote at
Westminster, cholera broke out afresh among the construction
party in India. By the end of May it was spreading among them
"like a raging fire"; while to the cholera itself there was added
a heat so intense that even the most willing of workers found it
almost unendurable.</p>

<p>Under this combination of cholera and excessive heat, work
on the lower sections of the line was stopped altogether for a
time&mdash;Government orders and Russians notwithstanding. All
possible measures were taken to mitigate the severity of the
epidemic; but the death-rate increased with frightful rapidity.
Some of the best workers, European and Asiatic&mdash;men who could
least be spared, on account of the responsible positions they held&mdash;were
carried off. During the month of June no fewer than
2,000 died out of 10,000. Of the remainder large numbers sought
safety in flight. Many of the minor Government officials, such as
telegraph and Post Office clerks, went off in a body.</p>

<p>Whilst sickness and disease had thus been afflicting the camps,
fresh troubles had arisen in another direction. Early in 1885
the district was visited by a succession of floods exceeding in
severity anything known there for sixty years. In the course
of three months the rainfall amounted to 19.27 inches,&mdash;a total
six times in excess of the average. Several bridges and many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
miles of temporary roads were washed away; numerous accidents
were caused; camping grounds were destroyed; communications
were interrupted; food supplies became scarcely obtainable,
and great delay resulted in the prosecution of a work for which
urgency was being so persistently demanded. The floods did
not finally subside until the end of May.</p>

<p>Nature having done so much to impede the progress of the
undertaking, it only remained for politicians and officials to do
what they could to follow her example.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the initial prohibition of
temporary lines of rails for the conveyance of stores and materials,
and the loss of time and waste of money involved in the use of
camels instead; but to this one fact may be added another,
namely, that after the Engineer-in-Chief had made his arrangements
to obtain sleepers from the juniper forests on the north
of the line&mdash;this being the only timber available in the whole
district&mdash;the Government vetoed the arrangement on the ground
that it might, possibly, lead to quarrels among the Afghan
tribes. The timber had to be procured from India, instead.
Hence more delay.</p>

<p>Then the original arrangement with the Engineer-in-Chief,
that the work was to be carried out under the Military Department
of the Indian Government, and that, in the interests of
urgency, he should have a free hand, was changed into one which
required that the work should be controlled by a new member
of the Public Works Department, who, it is alleged, interfered
with many of the working details which should have been left to
an Engineer-in-Chief, and, by his "unskilled and unqualified
control," caused still further delay, together with much expense
and confusion. A good deal of time was lost, for instance, before
Col. Browne could get even some indispensable instruments and
survey appliances. Especially persistent, also, was Col. Browne's
immediate superior in demanding from him "detailed estimates"
which, on account of the uncertainties of the engineering
work and of the other factors in the situation, it was
impossible to prepare whilst the construction of the line was in
progress.</p>

<p>Such, however, was the energy which had been shown, in spite
of all these difficulties and drawbacks, that the work was completed
within the two years and a half fixed by the Engineer-in-Chief
at the start as the period in which&mdash;"with money freely
granted"&mdash;it could be done. On March 27, 1887, an engine
ran over the line all the way from Sibi to Quetta, and the Hurnai
Railway was formally declared open for traffic.</p>

<p>In the meantime the apparent certainty of war with Russia,
following, especially, on her seizure of Penj-deh, had led, in April,
1885, to an order being given for the construction of a light railway<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
from Sibi through the Bolan Pass to Quetta, as an alternative,
more direct and more quickly constructed route, of which
use could be made for a movement of troops to the frontier on
the anticipated partial mobilisation of the Indian Army.</p>

<p>The laying of this light railway constituted another notable
engineering achievement.</p>

<p>Running through the heart of what has been described as
"some of the boldest mountain scenery in India," the Bolan Pass
has a length of about sixty miles and a breadth ranging from one
mile to a space, in places, of only about twenty yards between the
rugged mountain walls which here convert the pass into a mere
defile. The pass is, in fact, practically the bed of the Bolan
River, and is dry for the greater part of the year, but liable to
floods. The temporary narrow-gauge line was to be laid along
the river bed without interfering with the military road constructed
in 1882-84 as far as Quetta.</p>

<p>For the first forty miles there was a fairly good gradient; but
beyond that came a very heavy rise to the top of the pass; and
here, at least, anything more than a metre-gauge line would
have been impracticable. The possibility of constructing a
line of railway through the pass at all had long been the despair
of engineers, and this was the reason why the Hurnai route had
been decided on in preference to the Bolan for the broad-gauge
line to Quetta. Unfortunately, too, the climatic were even
greater than the engineering difficulties. The heat in the lower
parts of the pass was "beyond all description," and cholera or
other diseases carried off thousands of the workers.</p>

<p>With these two lines at their disposal, the Government were,
in the spring of 1887, quite prepared for a concentration of British
and Indian forces in Afghanistan, had the political condition
rendered such a course necessary; but the situation had by then
greatly improved, thanks to the negotiations which had been
proceeding with Russia for the demarcation of frontiers. In
April, 1877, the British and Russian commissioners met at St.
Petersburg, and, as the result of still further negotiations, the
questions at issue were settled without the appeal to arms which
had at one time appeared inevitable.</p>

<p>In 1892 some fifty miles of the Bolan light railway were abandoned
in favour of another route which, avoiding the first part
of the pass, allowed of a broad-gauge line being laid from Sibi
through Quetta to Bostan Junction, where it connects with what
is now known as the Hurnai-Pishin Loop. A branch ninety
miles in length, from Quetta to Mushki, on the Seistan trade
route, was opened in 1905.</p>

<p>To-day the Sind-Pishin railway, with its two sections, via the
Bolan and the Hurnai respectively, has its terminus at New
Chaman, on the actual frontier of Afghanistan, and within seventy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
miles of Kandahar. A broad-gauge line throughout, it forms
part of the railway system of India, linking up at Ruk junction
with the line running thence along the north bank of the Indus
to Karachi, and, by means of a bridge across the Indus, with a
line on the south of the river which, in one direction provides an
alternative route to Karachi, and in the other connects with
Calcutta and other leading cities. The Sind-Pishin line affords,
in fact, a most valuable means for concentrating on the Afghan
frontier, within a short distance of Kandahar, and in the shortest
possible time a considerable body of troops collected from all
parts of India, together with reinforcements from Europe, landed
at Karachi. As a strategical line, therefore, the railway is of
exceptional importance to India and to British interests in
general; though there can be no suggestion that it would be used
otherwise than for purely defensive purposes.</p>

<p>Then, in what, since 1901, has constituted the North-West
Frontier Province of India, there has been a considerable extension
of frontier railways in recent years,&mdash;all serving important
strategical purposes. From Peshawar&mdash;1,520 miles from Calcutta&mdash;there
is a broad-gauge extension, twelve miles in length,
to Fort Jamrud, at the mouth of the Khyber Pass; from Naushahra,
a cantonment twenty-seven miles due east of Peshawar,
there is a narrow-gauge line to Dargai, at the foot of the Malakand
Pass; while among other lines is one to Thal, a military outpost
on the extreme limit of British territory which serves also as a
depôt for the trade with Northern Afghanistan passing through
the Kurram valley; and one to Banu, a garrison town, seventy-nine
miles south of Kohat, built on a site chosen for political
reasons by Sir Herbert Edwards in 1848.</p>

<p>A number of other railways on the north-west frontiers of
India have been proposed. Whatever may or may not be
ultimately done in regard to these further schemes, it is obvious
that those already constructed have made an enormous difference
in our strategical position in regard to Afghanistan and the lands
beyond as compared with the military transport conditions of
1878.</p>

<h3>THE DEFENCE OF AUSTRALIA</h3>

<p>With a total area of 2,948,000 square miles, a population of
less than four and a half million, and a coast line of 11,300 miles,
the continent of Australia is peculiarly open to attack, and the
possibilities of invasion, or of attempts at invasion, have not
only been much discussed there of late years, but they have given
rise to schemes of land defence in which the building of strategical
railways and the adapting of existing lines to strategical purposes
form important factors.</p>

<p>Under present conditions Western Australia and the Northern
Territory are isolated from the remaining States of the Commonwealth
so far as regards rail communication, and are at the mercy
of any invader who might be able to land a force there unchallenged
by the British Fleet.</p>

<p>Since the autumn of 1912, however, there has been under
construction a railway which, starting from Kalgoorlie, the
eastern terminus of the Western Australian system, will proceed
in a direct line for 1,063 miles to Port Augusta, on the South
Australian system, thus establishing through rail connection
between Perth (Western Australia) and the farthest limit of the
Queensland railway system, a total distance, that is, of about
4,000 miles. When this, the first of Australia's proposed trans-continental
lines, is completed, it will be possible to send troops
from the Central or the Eastern States to Western Australia, not
only by rail, but by a railway laid so far inland that they will
be safe from attack from the sea. There would thus be a reasonable
certainty of the troops arriving at their destination; whereas
if they had to go by water there might be the risk of the vessels
in which they were making the journey being captured by the
enemy. While, therefore, the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta line is
expected to serve other than purely strategical purposes, it is,
in effect, the latter which claim first consideration.</p>

<p>Referring to the Northern Territory, in an article contributed
by him to <i>The Empire Review</i> for May, 1910, Mr. F. A. W.
Gisborne, an authority on Australian questions, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This vast region embraces 523,620 square miles of land, and lies
close to Asia, the most populous of the continents. At present it
contains, exclusive of the aborigines, barely one thousand white
people and about twice as many Chinese. It lacks railway communication
with the settled parts of Australia, and is completely isolated
from them. Its magnificent harbour, accessible to the largest vessels
afloat, and constituting the natural gateway to tropical Australia,
lies, save for the British Fleet, absolutely defenceless. Behind it
extend millions of acres of fertile plains never yet tilled, and never
likely to be cultivated by white hands. Practically no industry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>flourishes in a region which could support myriads of agriculturists
and operatives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That some of the peoples of crowded Asia may, sooner or later,
seek a settlement for their surplus millions on what, for them,
would be so desirable a land as the Northern Territory, with its
magnificent opportunities for those capable of working in a
tropical climate, is a contingency that has been fully realised in
Australia, and the questions have arisen (1) as to whether the
presence of a thousand whites in a region half a million square
miles in extent constitutes such "effective occupation" thereof
as gives them a right to its exclusive possession; and (2) whether
it would be possible either to prevent Asiatics from invading
the Northern Territory, if they sought so to do, or to eject them
therefrom if they did.</p>

<p>The latter question raises in an especially interesting form the
problem as to the respective merits and possibilities of sea-power
and rail-power.</p>

<p>Sea-power would, assuredly, have to be relied upon for safeguarding
the Northern Territory against invasion, since it would
be impossible for the Commonwealth Government to station
troops at every prospective landing point along 1,200 miles of a
tropical coast-line in sufficient force to keep off any invader who
might appear there at some unexpected moment. For the
checking, therefore, of such invasion, dependence would have
to be placed on the power of the British Fleet (1) to stop the
invader, (2) to cut off his connections if he should effect a landing,
or (3) to carry war into the invader's own country.</p>

<p>Nor, if any large Asiatic settlement&mdash;as distinct from an
"invasion" in the ordinary acceptation of that term&mdash;did take
place in the Northern Territory under conditions that might not
call for the intervention of the British Fleet, is it certain that
the ejection of the settlers could be ensured with the help even
of a trans-continental line of railway. Here the question is not
that of the carrying power of a single line of railway. The
examples offered by the War of Secession, the South African War
and the Russo-Japanese War have well established the great
advantages that even single lines, extending for great distances,
can confer in the effecting of military transport. The considerations
that would arise in Australia are, rather, (1) the fact that
troops arriving at Pine Creek or Port Darwin from the south might
have to make some very long and very trying marches across
the 523,000 square miles comprising the Northern Territory
before they reached the settlement of the Asiatics whom they
were to eject, while they would be dependent for their supplies
on a far-distant railway base; and (2) the doubt as to whether
Australia could spare a sufficiently large body of troops to undertake
such an expedition, having regard to the defence requirements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
of her south-eastern States, the integrity of which would
count as of more vital importance than an Asiatic settlement
in her Far North. So there are those who think that if such a
settlement were eventually effected in the Northern Territory,
under conditions not constituting a <i>casus belli</i>, Australia would
simply have to accept the situation, and reconcile herself to it as
best she could.</p>

<p>All these things may seem to reflect on the precise value, from
the rail-power point of view, of that direct communication which,
more especially for strategical reasons, Australia has hoped
eventually to obtain between north and south as well as between
west and east. It is, nevertheless, desirable to see what has
already been done in this direction.</p>

<p>The construction of a north-to-south trans-continental line,
passing through the very centre of the Australian mainland, and
linking up the Northern Territory with the southern and eastern
States, has been under discussion for a period of about forty
years. Progress seemed to be assured by the Acceptance Act
of 1910, under which the Government of the Commonwealth,
in taking over the Northern Territory from South Australia,
agreed to build a trans-continental line connecting Oodnadatta,
the northern terminus of the South Australian railway system,
and 688 miles from Adelaide, with Pine Creek, the southern
terminus of the Northern Territory system, and 145 miles distant
from Port Darwin. This connecting link would have a length
of 1,063 miles,&mdash;the same, by a singular coincidence, as that of
the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta line.</p>

<p>Since this "bargain" between the South Australia and the
Commonwealth Governments was made, there have been many
advocates of an alternative, or, otherwise, a supplementary route
which, instead of going direct from South Australia to the
Northern Territory, (passing through the central Australian
desert,) would link up&mdash;on their west&mdash;with the railway systems
of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, connections with
the new line being made by these States where necessary. This
"eastern deviation route" would, it is argued, offer a greater
strategical advantage, as compared with the other route, because
if troops had to be despatched to the north, they could more
readily be supplied from Melbourne and Sydney&mdash;which, between
them, contain over one-fourth of the entire population of Australia&mdash;than
from Adelaide; while to send troops from Queensland,
New South Wales and Victoria to South Australia in order
that they might start on their journey to the Northern Territory
from Oodnadatta, would involve a material delay under, possibly,
urgent conditions. Thus it is estimated that if the eastern
route were adopted, troops and travellers from Brisbane to Port
Darwin would only travel about 2,234 miles as against 3,691<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
miles via Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and the central Australian
route from Oodnadatta.</p>

<p>How these rival claims and contentions will be eventually
settled remains to be seen; but there has now been added to them
a project for the building of other avowedly strategical lines,
establishing a more direct connection between the Kalgoorlie-Port
Augusta trans-continental line, when it is finished, and the
capitals of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland respectively,
facilitating the mutual defence of the eastern, southern
and western States in a time of crisis. This further scheme is,
however, designed only to supplement the trans-continental
lines already mentioned.</p>

<p>As regards the eastern States and the "central" State of South
Australia, the question of an Asiatic invasion may be assumed
not to arise. It has, however, long been regarded as possible
that if Great Britain were at war with some non-Asiatic Power
able to challenge her supremacy on the seas, the enemy might
make an attack, not on the admittedly vulnerable Northern
Territory&mdash;which he would not want either as a colony for
Europeans or as a "jumping-off" place from which to conquer
the remainder of Australia&mdash;but on some point along the coast-line
of nearly 2,000 miles which, stretching from Rockhampton,
in Queensland, to Adelaide, in South Australia, comprises (with
a Hinterland of some 200 miles) the most populous, the most
wealthy and (for non-Asiatics) the most desirable section of the
whole Australian continent.</p>

<p>It is true that Germany&mdash;the Power which claims first attention
from this point of view&mdash;has shown far greater desire to convert
Africa into a German Empire than she has to effect the annexation
of Australia. Yet that she has recognized the weakness of the
Australian situation is suggested by the fact that, in dealing with
the defensive power of the Commonwealth, Dr. Rohrbach, one
of the exponents of German World-Policy, and author of "<span xml:lang="de">Deutschland
unter den Weltvölkern</span>," among other works, has declared
that Australia could not resist if her four chief towns, all of them
near the coast, were occupied by an invader.<a id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Which of these four towns, or which particular point along
the said 2,000 miles of coast-line, an invader would select for
his main attack&mdash;apart from feints elsewhere&mdash;must needs
be uncertain; but this very fact only adds to the imperative
importance of those responsible for the defence of Australia being
able to move troops freely, and within the shortest possible
period, either from one State to another or from any place to
another within one and the same State, as the defence conditions
might require.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>
<p>When we thus pass on to consider the question as to the use
of existing lines of railway in Australia for strategical purposes,
we find that the most noteworthy expression of opinion on this
branch of the subject is contained in the following extract from
the "Memorandum" which Lord Kitchener wrote in 1910, as
the result of an investigation made by him, at the request of the
Commonwealth Government, into the "Defence of Australia":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Railway construction has, while developing the country, resulted
in lines that would appear to be more favourable to an enemy invading
Australia than to the defence of the country. Different
gauges in most of the States isolate each system, and the want of
systematic interior connection makes the present lines running inland
of little use for defence, although possibly of considerable value to an
enemy who would have temporary command of the sea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The "different gauges" undoubtedly constitute one of the
most serious shortcomings of the existing railways in Australia in
regard to those military movements with which we are here alone
concerned.</p>

<p>Strategical considerations as applied to rail transport require,
not only that troops shall be readily conveyed, when necessary,
from one part of a country or one part of a continent to another,
but that a mobilisation of the forces shall be followed by a
mobilisation of railway rolling stock. Locomotives, carriages
and trucks on lines which are not themselves likely to be wanted
for military transport should be available for use on the lines
that will be so wanted, in order that all the rolling stock of all
the railways in all parts of the country or of the States concerned
can, at a time of possibly the gravest emergency, be concentrated
or employed on whatever lines, or in whatever direction, additional
transport facilities may be needed.</p>

<p>The importance of this principle was first recognised by von
Moltke; but when the railways of Australia were originally
planned, each State took a more or less parochial view of its own
requirements, its own geographical conditions, or its own resources,
and adopted the gauge which accorded best therewith,
regardless of any future need for a co-ordinated system of rail-transport
serving the requirements of the Australian continent as
a whole.</p>

<p>So we find that the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge has been adopted in
Queensland, South Australia (with a further 600 miles of 5 ft.
3 in. gauge), Western Australia, and the Northern Territory;
the 4 ft. 8&frac12; in. gauge (the standard gauge in Great Britain and,
also, of over 65 per cent. of the world's railway mileage,) in New
South Wales; and the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge in Victoria. This means,
in most cases, that when the frontier of a State is reached, passengers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
mails, baggage and merchandise must change or be transferred
from the trains on the one system to those of the other.</p>

<p>Assuming that the west-to-east trans-continental railway
(which is being built with the 4 ft. 8&frac12; in. gauge) were now available
for use, a traveller by it from Perth, Western Australia, through
South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland
would require, on account of the differences in gauge, to change
trains at least five times. This may be regarded as an extreme
case; but the evils of the existing conditions are presented to
us in a concrete form by an estimate which the Defence Department
of the Commonwealth recently made as to the time it would
take to move a force of 30,000 mounted troops from Melbourne
to Brisbane. It was shown that, with the present break of gauge,
this operation would occupy no less a time than sixty-three days;
whereas if there were no break of gauge twenty-three days would
suffice. Thus the differences of gauge would mean a loss of forty
days in effecting transfers at the frontier. In this time much
might happen if the enemy had obtained temporary control of the
sea. Under these conditions, in fact, he would be able to move
his own forces by sea for the still longer distance from Adelaide
to Brisbane in five days. Brisbane might thus be captured
by the enemy while the reinforcements it wanted were still
changing trains at the State boundaries.</p>

<p>It may be of interest here to recall the fact that at one time
there were still greater differences of gauge on the railways in
the United States; that in 1885 the American railway companies
resolved upon establishing uniformity as a means of overcoming
the great inconveniences due to these conditions; and
that in 1886, after adequate preparation, the conversion of practically
the entire system of railways in the United States to the
4 ft. 8&frac12; in. gauge was effected in two days. Strategically, therefore,
the United States Federal Government could now, not only
send troops by rail from any one part of their vast territory to
another, but utilise almost the whole of the available rolling
stock for military purposes.<a id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Unification of gauge forms, however, a serious proposition for
Australia on account of the prodigious outlay which, owing
to the short-sighted policy of the past, it would now involve.<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The estimated cost of converting all the 4 ft. 8&frac12; in. gauge in
New South Wales and all the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge in Queensland,
South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory
to the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge of Victoria is no less than £51,659,000. To
convert all the 3 ft. 6 in. and 5 ft. 3 in. railways to the 4 ft. 8&frac12;
in. gauge of the New South Wales lines would cost £37,164,000.
To convert to the 4 ft. 8&frac12; in. gauge all the trunk lines connecting
the capitals&mdash;and this without shortening the present circuitous
routes or modifying the heavy grades&mdash;would alone cost about
£12,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to this still undecided "battle of the gauges"
there are in Australia other disadvantages, from a strategical
standpoint, in the existing railway system, included therein
being (1) an undue preponderance of single over double track, so
that any exceptional amount of traffic causes a congestion which
is likely only to be aggravated by new lines constructed, or
extensions made, before the carrying capacity of the trunk lines
has been increased; and (2) the building of lines which either
lead nowhere or have been expressly stopped short of the boundaries
of a State in order to retain, for the railways of that State,
traffic from outlying districts which would pass, by a much
shorter journey, to the port of a neighbouring State if, by means
of through railway connexion, the residents in the districts
concerned were free to avail themselves of their geographical
advantage in respect to their nearness to such port.</p>

<p>In addition to the efforts she has already made, or is proposing
to make, to effect such improvement both in her railway system
and in her military transport facilities as may be practicable,
Australia has sought to provide for that effective organisation
without which, as experience elsewhere has fully shown, great
and even disastrous confusion may arise at a critical moment
owing to conflicts of authority and other troubles or difficulties
in the working of such railways as may be utilised for military
movements.</p>

<p>The action taken in this direction is based on a further recommendation
made by Lord Kitchener, who, in the course of
his Memorandum to the Commonwealth Government in 1910
said (paragraph 85):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Preparation for mobilisation is primarily the work of the General
Staff, who recommend the lines to be followed and advise where,
and in what quantities, the munitions of war of the various units
should be stored. Concentration can only be satisfactorily effected
when the railway and military authorities are in the closest touch,
and work in absolute harmony. To secure this co-operation, I
advise that a War Railway Council be formed, as is the case in the
United Kingdom, composed of the Chief Railway Commissioner
from each State, under the presidency of the Quartermaster-General
of the Citizen Forces, and with an officer of the Headquarters Staff
as secretary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A War Railway Council for the Commonwealth was duly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
constituted in 1911. The Council, which forms an adjunct of
the Commonwealth Defence Department, consists of the Quartermaster-General,
(president,) the senior officer of the Engineer and
Railway Staff Corps also created for the railway system alike of
the Commonwealth and of each State (such senior officer being
the Chief or the Deputy Commissioner of Railways); the Consulting
Military Engineer of the Commonwealth, and two representatives
of the naval and military forces, with a military
officer as secretary. The duties of the Council in time of peace
are, generally, to furnish advice to the Minister of Defence on
railway matters, and, particularly (<i>a</i>) to determine the method of
supplying information to, and obtaining it from, the different
railway departments; (<i>b</i>) to suggest regulations and instructions
for carrying out movement of troops; (<i>c</i>) to suggest the method
of organising railway staff officers in time of war to act as intermediaries
between the various railway authorities and the
troops; (<i>d</i>) to consider the question of extra sidings, loading
platforms, etc.; and proposals for unification of gauges; and
(<i>e</i>) to suggest the organisation and system of training of railway
troops. In time of war the Council further advises the Minister
of defence on questions of mobilisation. The organisation for
military rail-transport in the several States follows on the lines
of the system already adopted in the United Kingdom, as laid
down in the Field Service Regulations.</p>

<p>The following list of books, pamphlets and articles bearing
on the evolution and the development of rail-power down to
the outbreak of the Great War in 1914&mdash;this alone being the
purpose and the scope of the present work&mdash;was originally
based on selections from a "List of References on the Use of
Railroads in War" prepared by the Bureau of Railway Economics,
Washington, D.C., U.S.A., and including items from all
the leading libraries of the United States (Library of Congress;
the libraries of the principal Universities, Colleges and learned
or technical societies; State libraries, public libraries, private
railway-libraries, and the library of the Bureau itself), together
with various foreign libraries, such as those of the Minister of
Public Works in Berlin, the International Railway Congress at
Berne, and others besides.</p>

<p>Much valuable help has been derived from the American list;
but a large number of its references, and especially those relating
to the World-War itself, have not here been reproduced, while so
many additions have been gathered in from other sources
among which might be mentioned the published catalogue of
the War Office Library; the libraries of the British Museum,
the Royal Colonial Institute, and the Patent Office; the
<i>Journal</i> of the Royal United Service Institution, the publications
of the Royal Engineers' Institute, and official or other
publications in Great Britain, France, etc., that the Bibliography
here presented may, perhaps, be regarded as practically
a new compilation, supplementing the excellent purpose which
the list of the American Bureau of Railway Economics will
undoubtedly serve.</p>
